THE APOTHECARY DARIES

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.950
‎THIS STORY IS A FICTION AND ALL NAMES OF FIGURES AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS.
MOREOVER, THE STORY HAS NO RELATIONTO REAL-LIFE INCIDENTS AND EVENTS.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.220
Rumors tend to spread rapidly.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.850
The further and wider they spread,
the more they deviate from the truth.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.730
At times, rumors cease
to remain mere rumors...

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.810
Legends and myths

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.480
may be somewhat similar in that regard.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.800
Episode 29: The Moon Fairy

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:56.740
I'm leaving.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.490
Take care.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.410
An overgrown peach orchard
to the north of the rear palace.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.910
Nearby is an old shrine-like building.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.290
And a pond.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.830
It is said that in the past,

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.290
another people once lived in this area,

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.460
and the remaining structures, outer walls,

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.920
and underground waterways
are still in use today.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.260
- Whoa.
- Guess who?

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.970
Shisui.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.350
Correct! Was it my voice
that gave it away?

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.730
This friendliness...

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.940
As expected of Xiaolan’s chatting buddy.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.860
Maomao, what are you doing here?

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.610
What about you, Shisui? Why are you here?

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.650
Me? I just have a little errand to run.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.620
- Snacking?
- No, but...

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.330
Look at this!

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.830
Isn't it cute?

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.550
Normally, this would be
considered harassment,

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.090
so it’s better not to do it.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.880
Eh? Why? It’s so cute!

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.550
This place really is amazing, isn’t it?

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.100
There are many insects here
that I've only seen in picture books.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.350
This is the first time
I've seen this bug too!

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.560
Huh, is that so?

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.730
This land has been trading
for a long time.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.860
This bug probably came
mixed in with goods from abroad

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.570
and it successfully reproduced.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.320
- Will this turn into a butterfly?
- Nope, they're moths.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.660
Since they're nocturnal,
they're not flying right now,

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.080
but they are beautiful moths!

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.460
I wonder if they were around
when the old lady danced?

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.040
Maomao, you should come
see it at night too.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.460
It glimmers softly under the moonlight...

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.550
It feels like you’ve
wandered into paradise.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.840
That’s a bit of an exaggeration...

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.430
Glimmering in the moonlight...

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.770
Do these moths mate
right after they hatch?

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.770
Probably. Once they become adults,
they can’t eat food,

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.810
so they die pretty quickly, I heard.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.230
Hey, can you tell the difference between
male and female moths?

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.150
I think I can, roughly...

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.780
Shisui!

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.660
I need your help with something.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.250
This might... just work!

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.830
Is it something bad?

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.070
A few days later,

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.660
a banquet was held to welcome the envoys.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.410
It took place in the northern garden
where the "Moon Spirit"

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.540
appeared 50 years ago.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.630
Normally, men are forbidden in the palace,

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.840
but as a special exception,
male officials were granted entry.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.260
Even senior-ranking consorts
participated in the event.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.260
Attendees enjoyed the banquet
from inside their carriages.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.970
This was also a gesture
to avoid treating the foreign envoys

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.980
as mere spectacles...

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.480
Blue eyes and golden hair...

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.020
Such beauties.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.110
We can't deceive them with bad actors.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.490
Moreover, raising their curtain
all the way up

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.200
to allow the Emperor to see their faces

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.530
shows just how much confidence they have.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.910
Above all, while the demure beauty
sitting in the back is striking,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.160
the ones in the front

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.750
are full of confidence, knowing that
they are more beautiful than anyone else.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.920
There’s no doubt that
these two foreign beauties

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.260
are stunning enough to rival
the senior-ranking consorts.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.150
The performances and music
are flashier than usual.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.440
It must be tailored to suit the envoys.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.690
But...

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.150
they look rather bored themselves.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.450
Are they trying to say it’s disappointing?

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.200
Even so, they really do look alike...

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.740
I heard they’re cousins who share the same
grandfather, but they look like twins.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.410
If it’s those two, the "mirror story"

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.620
that Lord Gaoshun mentioned
might actually be possible.

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:36.270
Good day. Even though this is
such a rare banquet,

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.100
it’s such a shame
we’re seated so far apart.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.940
I would much prefer
to talk a little closer.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.150
I heard the Emperor’s younger brother
is absent today.

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.990
I was really hoping to meet him.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.830
Ugh, scary. Truly scary...

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.870
The true purpose of the special envoys

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.290
is to gain the favor of

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.580
the Emperor and his brother,

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.170
securing marriage ties with them.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.800
Probably for political reasons.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.710
If it pleases you...

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.760
Ayla,

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.260
you should head back soon.
It's a rare performance,

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.470
and you ought to enjoy it properly.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.640
My apologies.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:29.110
Hongniang!

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:31.240
Somehow they managed.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.360
I was so nervous.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.370
The two beauties may not be interested

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.660
in the most beautiful woman

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.370
that their grandfather saw.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.920
"There's no one more beautiful
in the world than ourselves."

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.960
That's how they take pride in themselves.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:48.880
At this rate, the reason they gave
mirrors to the four consorts

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.420
might have been a form of provocation.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.300
Well, it’s fine. My job is

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.720
to show those two the Moon Spirit.

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:04.900
It seems like the banquet is about to end.
How's it going?

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:08.940
I've done everything... I could.

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:14.240
Well, that’s the kind of reaction
I’d expect.

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:18.620
Shall we go?

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.790
The music seemed to have been
made more extravagant

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.800
to suit us,

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.970
but the dance wasn’t anything special,
was it, Aylin?

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:37.350
Even the so-called four consorts
remained hidden behind the screens.

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:40.770
Regarding the Moon Spirit our grandfather
saw, how impressive could it really be?

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:44.100
Ayla, this isn’t the place
to talk about that.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:46.690
We can talk in my room afterwards.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:53.150
We might hear from the Emperor
himself any moment now.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:11.880
This guy!

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:35.820
Fifty years ago,

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.660
the scene the envoy's grandfather saw

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.370
could have been something like this.

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.140
Diana.

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:11.230
I wasn’t confident
about the pronunciation,

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:12.980
but it seems to have gotten across.

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:18.240
The name of the Moon Goddess

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.110
from the West.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:23.700
It seems to have gone well.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:27.330
Yes, I think it turned out as I expected.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.830
If you remove the black cloth in the dark,

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.540
it seems as though he suddenly appears.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.550
Above all, the key is those moths.

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:38.050
In the painting of the old lady,

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:40.260
the light that shines

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:41.640
is of an adult moth.

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.390
The old lady said that
they were bothering her.

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:45.890
On the day of the event,

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:48.270
there were people who played
a prank on my outfit.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:51.270
They rubbed insect corpses onto it.

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.520
Among insects, some emit a scent

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:56.030
to attract the opposite sex.

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:58.820
The males, attracted to the smell,

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.660
gathered around the old lady.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:04.490
They looked like moon spirits
dancing in the light.

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:06.580
What a coincidence...

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:11.040
I need to thank Shisui
and Xiaolan for their help.

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:16.800
But it was difficult to show
that view only to the envoys.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.050
I had already instructed the coachman
not to look this way.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:23.800
Lord Gaoshun and his men
were on standby nearby,

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:26.850
ready to jump into action
if anything was to happen.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.060
That is not something
to be shown to everyone.

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.140
A beauty...

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:35.400
so captivating that
he could topple a kingdom.

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:37.070
Hey!

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:40.070
I did what you said
and you just leave me stranded?

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:44.280
Thank you, Lord Jinshi.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:47.540
For swimming across the pond
with that heavy outfit on.

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:50.200
So did it go well?

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:53.120
Yes, I believe I fulfilled

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:55.580
the envoy's request to the utmost.

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:59.090
Well, I did my job!

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:00.590
My hair's still wet!

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.180
Why don't you do it yourself?

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:22.860
Then, fine.

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:33.660
Oh, Maomao.

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.040
I'm going to the new school!

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.840
Oh, it opened without any issues.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.510
I'm going to be a first-year student!

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:45.380
I'm off then.

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:46.800
Do your best.

00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:59.570
I'm so bored.

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:03.820
There isn't much work to do
back at the Jade Pavilion either...

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.860
The quack doctor's place is...

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:09.330
probably swamped
with the perfume incident.

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:12.080
That perfume incident

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.250
isn't completely over.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.210
Even if each individual amount is small,

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:19.250
it can become a poison
depending on the combination.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.760
Who in the world would arrange
for such a thing to be brought in?

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.180
I'm investigating, but

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.260
each Pavilion purchased
a large amount of perfume.

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:32.220
The attendants of
the Jade Pavilion did too.

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:34.520
I had anything poisonous disposed of, but...

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:37.900
For example, is there
any possibility that the envoys

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.150
could have arranged this?

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:42.150
I wonder. Perhaps their aim was to

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:46.400
infiltrate the ranks of the consorts.

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:48.070
But their pride must be so shattered,

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.450
it's not worth their time.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.540
There are four high-ranking consorts
in the palace.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:01.960
Considering their families' power,

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:05.590
the most important one
would be Consort Loulan.

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:08.300
Her father, Shishou,

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.390
was a favored minister who was
highly-regarded by the previous emperor.

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:14.560
The current emperor visits him regularly,

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.690
but his enthusiasm doesn't seem very high.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.770
The next highest-ranking consort
is Consort Lihua,

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.610
but due to being
a relative of the emperor,

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:26.990
she isn't the ambitious type.

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:30.030
She fell ill after losing
her crown prince,

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:33.080
but she has regained the emperor's favor.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.660
On the other hand,

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:38.910
the family of Consort Lishu who
has risen in rank in recent generations,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.790
is so ambitious, having offered their
young daughter to the previous emperor.

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:47.260
Unfortunately, the emperor
prefers fuller-bodied women,

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.630
and even after Consort Ah-Duo left,

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.640
she hasn't become his consort.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:56.350
On the other hand, the emperor favors
Consort Gyokuyou the most.

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:58.730
In addition to having their daughter,
Princess Lingli,

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:01.230
she is pregnant
with the emperor's child again.

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.110
Her homeland, the western country,

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:06.610
seems to be prosperous from trade,

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:08.490
but the land is barren

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:10.780
and it's not exactly prosperous.

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:13.530
Consort Gyokuyou has twice
been the victim of

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:15.530
an attempted assassination
by poison in the past.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.750
The incident at the garden party
last year was

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:21.750
carried out by
the head attendant of Consort Ah-Duo,

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:24.670
who acted on her own
to target Consort Lishu.

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:28.210
But the reason wasn't for power,

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:31.340
it was a very human motive.

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:33.760
But before that,

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:37.510
who poisoned Consort Gyokuyou when
she was pregnant with Princess Lingli?

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.060
Who could it have been?

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:42.230
If Lady Hongniang is right,

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:46.070
the culprit is the mid-ranking consort
who died in the recent mushroom incident.

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:48.230
However, how did the mid-ranking consort

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.450
acquire knowledge of poison?

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:53.740
Suirei.

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:57.080
Her whereabouts are still unknown.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.830
Why...? For what reason...?

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:03.540
What was her goal
in targeting Lord Jinshi?

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:09.170
It's useless for
a mere poison tester to think about this?

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.170
I think I'll do something
to clear my head.

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:18.390
Cherry season is almost over...

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:22.600
Those are the attendants
from the Crystal Pavilion.

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:24.560
Oh my!

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:30.530
They're making a big fuss over nothing.

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:35.410
She's the only attendant

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:37.780
in the Crystal Pavilion
who doesn't wear any perfume.

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:46.000
I thought it was unusual
in the fashion-conscious Crystal Palace,

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:48.290
but maybe there's at least one person...

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.550
I'm feeling a bit under the weather.

00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.470
Don't get sick.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.640
What if you pass it on to
Lady Gyokuyou and the others?

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:04.560
I was being careful...

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:09.110
You have a slight fever.

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:11.230
Should I make you
some herbal medicine for a cold?

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:13.900
Then, after you make the medicine,

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:16.780
could you take her to the clinic?

00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:18.780
The clinic?

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:21.330
It's different from the medical office.

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:23.580
Anyway, Ailan knows about it.

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.540
- So, please take her there.
- Understood.

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:34.340
I had no idea there was a place
like this in the north of the palace.

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.300
Having a laundry nearby is

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:40.510
quite practical for frequent washing
of clothes and bedding.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.350
- Excuse me, I think I've caught a cold.
- Huh?

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.810
It's rare to see
a middle-aged palace woman.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.940
You have a slight fever.
Stick out your tongue.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.740
It doesn't seem too bad.

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.700
You'll be fine as long as you don't
overexert yourself for a few days.

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:00.820
What do you want to do?

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:03.870
I can't infect the consorts,

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.370
so could I please
stay the night here just to be safe?

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:08.670
Come with me.

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:11.420
She's much more experienced
than that quack doctor,

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:13.630
and she's very good at diagnosis.

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:19.550
I can't stand this smell.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.600
It smells like alcohol.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:23.510
It's a sign of cleanliness.

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.020
There are many windows,
so it's well-ventilated.

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:30.440
Despite its simplicity, it's very clean.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.690
I think it's the perfect place
for recuperation.

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:36.360
Please use this room.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.280
Thank you.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:41.370
Maomao, tell them I'll be back tomorrow.

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:42.280
Understood.

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:49.250
Sick attendants

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:52.130
are isolated like this, huh?

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:54.840
You go back to work.

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:58.050
Don't think you can slack off
just because you're accompanying her.

00:18:58.130 --> 00:18:59.420
What is it?

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:02.850
Or are you going to fold
all the laundry here?

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:06.060
Excuse me!

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:10.560
I knew I couldn't beat the older lady...

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.560
Nevertheless,

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:15.230
there are only older palace women here.

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.190
In the rear palace, when you get older,

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.440
you're almost forced to be replaced,

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:23.070
but in the clinic, experience
and knowledge are necessary,

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.200
so they can probably stay longer...

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:31.370
Don't mumble to yourself
as you walk. You'll trip.

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:33.540
Was I saying something?

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:37.550
Is there something you need?

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.380
No, I don't need anything, but

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:43.510
is it wrong to talk to someone
I happen to meet?

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:50.060
- Where were you at?
- The clinic.

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:52.390
I didn't know there was a place like that.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.900
When you first entered the palace,

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:57.820
you were supposed to be shown everything,
but I guess it was overlooked.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.240
I probably wasn't listening at the time

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:03.160
because I had been sold and was so upset.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:09.830
Every time I talk about this,
I get kind of depressed.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:14.290
I was surprised by
how well-equipped it was.

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:17.590
Actually, shouldn't that place be
the medical office?

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.800
If that were possible, it would be great.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.720
What do you mean?

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.970
Because only men can be medical officers.

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:28.140
Minor injuries are one thing, but

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:30.930
only medical officers can
handle serious injuries.

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:34.940
And of course, only medical officers
can prepare medicine.

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:38.400
That's why there was
no smell of medicine in the clinic.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.940
I see.

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:42.490
What will happen to me?

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:45.820
Turn a blind eye to it.

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:50.330
There seems to be
some complicated circumstances involved.

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:52.410
For the future,

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:55.830
we should find a different way
to recruit medical officers.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
So that one can become one
without being a eunuch.

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:02.010
Eunuchs...

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.380
After the current emperor took the throne,

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:08.680
the surgery to become a eunuch
was banned. So in the future,

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.270
it's clear that there will be
a shortage of manpower.

00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:15.140
Considering Lord Jinshi's age,

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:18.770
he probably had the surgery
just before it was banned.

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.650
It's a pity. If he had
waited a few more years...

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.070
What?

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:27.320
Oops, I said it out loud.

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.370
Lord Jinshi, you still have other work.

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:33.620
Understood.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:36.870
And, apothecary,

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:41.880
make sure no one else knows
that you're preparing medicine.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.550
Understood.

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:51.390
If I made a growth potion,
would I make a profit?

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.190
That's medicine, isn't it?

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:01.520
The maid I saw earlier
smelled of medicine.

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:05.070
That maid...

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:08.450
She's secretly making medicine, isn't she?

00:23:46.000 --> 00:24:00.930
NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW

The next episode is "Once Again, Crystal Pavilion."
