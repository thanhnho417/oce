THE APOTHECARY DARIES

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.550
‎THIS STORY IS A FICTION AND ALL NAMES OF FIGURES AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS.
MOREOVER, THE STORY HAS NO RELATION TO REAL-LIFE INCIDENTS AND EVENTS.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.800
Let me introduce them to you, Maomao.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.680
These are the new attendants
at the Jade Pavilion.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.850
They’re three sisters.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.220
I’m Haku-u.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.640
I’m Koku-u.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.600
I’m Seki-u.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.100
They really do look alike…

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.810
How have you been?

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.650
Fine. It’s been a while.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.690
Do you know each other?

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.070
Yes, we’re from the same hometown
and are familiar with each other.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.410
The eldest, Haku-u,

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.780
is the same age as Lady Gyokuyou.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.040
So they're surrounding her
only with people from her hometown?

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.000
For Lady Gyokuyou
who has been nearly assassinated before,

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.920
this arrangement would be safer.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:13.670
And you are?

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.760
I am Maomao, the food taster, Lady Koku-u.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.760
I'm not Koku-u.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.300
Oh, then you must be Lady Seki-u…

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:23.760
I’m Haku-u.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.360
From now on, we’ll wear
hair ribbons that match our names.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.320
-Then you can tell us apart.
-Understood.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.110
I really can’t tell them apart…

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.490
Well, I guess
I’ll figure it out over time.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.700
But more importantly…

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.660
Maomao!

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.910
Return to your designated room!

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.960
No, the storage room is fine for me.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.040
Even Lady Hongniang told me
this is my room,

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.000
so I’ll continue using it as it is.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.420
I will not allow that!

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.180
You took that joke
too seriously once again!

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.600
But I’ve already moved
all my belongings here…

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.640
It wouldn’t set a good example
for the new attendants!

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.020
What are you two doing?!

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.000
Episode 34: Ghost Stories

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.160
Oh my.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.250
Has the storage room
completely turned into Maomao’s nest?

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.000
You can do as you like with the shed.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.500
But when you sleep,
please use your designated room.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.960
Understood.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.380
They’re such kind superiors.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.430
With the arrival of new attendants,

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.770
the workload per person
has significantly decreased.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.440
With Lady Gyokuyou expecting a child,

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.320
the Jade Pavilion will need
even more hands.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.280
So reinforcing the workforce
is certainly a good thing…

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.910
But this is also likely an effort
to balance things out

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.250
with Lady Loulan’s Garnet Pavilion,
which has a large number of maids.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.500
Thanks for your hard work.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.380
Well then, I’ll head to the shed.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.420
Maomao!

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.300
Lady Yinghua,
does Maomao really live in a shed,

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.300
instead of a proper room?

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.510
Is that true? Even though
she’s Lady Gyokuyou’s attendant?

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.970
Well…

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.860
The reason Lady Yinghua is trying to stop
me from shutting myself away in the shed

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.870
is because
she’s looking out for my well-being.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.120
She wants me to quickly feel at ease with
the new attendants.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.830
It’s a reflection of her thoughtfulness.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.510
I’m sorry for acting so selfishly.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.470
It’s fine, but…

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.470
Hey, Maomao, do you feel
even a little remorse?

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.260
Huh? I do, of course.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.850
Really? Do you actually feel bad?

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:15.390
Yes, of course…

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.100
I thought so!

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.610
Then tonight, you’re coming with me!

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.860
Tonight, the only ones free are
you and me, Maomao!

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.240
How convenient!

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.620
I walked right into that…

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.000
Uh, about going out tonight,
what did Lady Hongniang say?

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.960
It’s fine. I already got her permission.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.720
The north side of the rear palace…

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.340
There should only be
old buildings around here.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:54.390
Maomao, here.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.850
Put this on like this.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.150
Isn’t this hot?

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.860
It’s fine. It’ll feel cooler soon.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.070
Here we are.

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.620
Welcome. Two participants, correct?

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.370
Yes, we’re looking forward to it.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.130
Likewise.

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.590
Turn off the lanterns
and use these instead.

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.430
She's beautiful,
but quite an aged palace woman.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.770
Now, let’s begin.

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.400
This place was used
during the previous emperor’s reign.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.570
There are far fewer palace women
now than back then,

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.910
but for something like this, it’s perfect.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.830
Take a seat wherever there’s space.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.170
Everyone’s here.

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:11.010
Gathering 12 people in a closed room
on such a hot day…

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:15.720
Everyone, are you ready for the stories?

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:21.230
Tonight, let's enjoy 13 chilling tales.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.400
Thirteen tales?

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.860
And so…

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:31.650
Night after night,
at the moat by the north gate,

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.870
there was a figure of a maid
repeatedly throwing herself in.

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:39.160
Feeling pity, a palace woman
floated flowers in the water,

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.910
when suddenly from somewhere,
a voice could be heard…

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.960
Startled, she looked into the moat, and…

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.590
the maid’s pale face
floated to the surface.

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:50.260
As the palace woman panicked
and tried to flee,

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:52.180
she was suddenly grabbed by the leg.

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:57.220
The maid, crawling out of the water, said…

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:02.640
"That day, the one who pushed me in…

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:07.320
Was it you?!"

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.700
This sounds like a story
I've heard somewhere before.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:18.120
She's scared, but it seems
she's enjoying it.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.790
Apparently, this event involves
telling ghost stories in order of seating

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.210
and blowing out a candle
after finishing each tale.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:34.970
However, most of the stories
are just rear palace rumors.

00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:36.970
Not exactly chilling to the bone.

00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:43.350
After all, there's little entertainment
in the rear palace.

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:46.650
That's probably why
such gatherings are permitted.

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:51.610
-Good evening.
-Shisui.

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:53.610
-Want some?
-I'll have a piece.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.540
Now then…

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:04.580
This is a story from my hometown.

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:07.420
There was a forest,

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.590
which had long been said
to be forbidden to enter.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.130
Anyone who entered would be cursed,

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.680
and their soul would be
devoured by a demon.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.100
But one day,

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:22.470
a child broke this taboo.

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:25.520
That year, crops had failed,

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.020
and the child, starving beyond endurance,

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:31.360
entered the forest in search of food.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.360
The child told his mother,

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:38.910
"I'll tell you something good.

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:41.700
There’s plenty of food in that forest."

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:46.830
However, when the villagers learned
that the child had entered the forest,

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:49.130
the mother and child
were cast out from the village.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.800
Isolated, with nothing to eat,

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.010
they grew frail and weak.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:57.800
Yet, no one reached out to help them.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.850
One night,

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:02.640
someone saw a flickering light

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.430
enter the mother and child's home.

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:10.230
The next day, upon hearing the news,

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:11.940
the village chief
went to visit their home.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:14.900
But the child was already dead,

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:17.150
and the mother was on the verge of death.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.160
With her last breath,
she said to the village chief,

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:24.660
"I'll tell you something good…"

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:29.120
And with that, she died.

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:33.840
Her face bore an eerie smile.

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:38.670
In the end, no one knew
what she had meant to say.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.970
Even now, the forest is feared
as a forbidden land.

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:43.800
And they say that a demon appears

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:45.640
at the homes of those who break the taboo,

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.350
devouring their souls.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:55.270
-Hmm, I see…
-See what?

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.900
I’ll tell you later.

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:01.070
I'm kinda sleepy…

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.240
There are so many people
in such a small space.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.620
I’m feeling dizzy from the crowd.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.750
Now it's your turn.

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:10.210
Okay!

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:17.590
This is a story from a far,
far eastern land.

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.340
A certain monk,

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:24.720
on his way back after conducting
a funeral in a distant place,

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.470
realized that night had already fallen.

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.440
The area was an open plain
covered in silver grass,

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.480
and it seemed that a pack of stray dogs
were lurking nearby.

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:38.070
As the anxious monk looked around,

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:40.490
he spotted an old, worn-down house.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.830
Pardon the late hour. Is anyone home?

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:49.700
What brings you here, dear monk?

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:53.040
Before I could cross the mountain,
night fell…

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.250
If you wouldn’t mind,
even a corner of the barn would do.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.210
Could you let me stay for just one night?

00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:01.510
Oh my… You must be exhausted.

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:05.260
The wife fed him

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:08.260
and even prepared
a sleeping place for him.

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:11.600
Moved by her heartfelt hospitality,

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.230
the monk, who had
nothing to offer in return,

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:17.270
decided to at least recite a sutra
as a token of gratitude.

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:25.570
Is that the sound of a bell?

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:29.200
No… It sounds like a bell, but…

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.160
Is this… a human voice?

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:35.170
So, what will you do?

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:37.420
Nothing. It should be fine as it is.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.090
No, that won’t do!

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:42.010
I don’t want to be alone.

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:44.300
Then, what do you plan to do?!

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:46.720
I can't take this anymore…

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:52.020
Are they arguing? Should I step in?

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:56.400
No. I mustn’t interfere.
I just have that feeling…

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.860
-That monk… we'll use him instead.
-I guess there’s no other way…

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:04.450
Alright, let's do this.

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:09.620
Where is he? Where’s the monk?

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:22.760
Did he escape?

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:27.800
He’s not here. He’s gone!

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:31.640
I have to find him. Otherwise, I…

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.140
I…

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:41.150
The monk

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:45.490
continued chanting the sutra,
until the sounds of chewing stopped.

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:50.450
When the noise ceased,
the monk stepped outside.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:54.700
The young couple was nowhere to be seen,
and in their place…

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.250
only insect wings lay scattered
on the ground.

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:02.500
The monk quietly pressed his hands
together in prayer

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:05.970
and continued walking,
chanting the sutra, until dawn.

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:09.550
She's really good at telling stories.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.470
It’s like she's
a completely different person.

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:14.970
This side profile…

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:18.480
Feels like I’ve seen it somewhere before…

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:22.820
Maomao. You’re up next.

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:24.610
Oh, right…

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:27.150
What should I talk about…?

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:31.320
My foster father once told me a story.

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:34.910
There was a rumor that ghostly fireballs
appeared in the graveyard.

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.210
It sounded suspicious,

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:41.710
so a group of brave young men
went to investigate.

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:44.300
And what they found was…

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.050
A man from the same town,

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:54.680
walking with a torch in his hand.

00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:58.810
-That’s it?
-Yes.

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:01.480
The man was a grave robber,

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:03.650
trapped by a sinister curse.

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:06.650
He would dig up graves,
cut open corpses’ bellies,

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:09.990
and take human livers,
said to cure rare diseases--

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:11.240
Enough!

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:14.240
That’s all…

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:19.370
You're next, Lady Yinghua.

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:23.250
Well…

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.880
There was once a man…

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.760
No, an old woman…?

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:31.760
And then… Um…

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.590
So then… Um…

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:41.020
Then, I’ll go next.

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:43.230
Come to think of it,

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:46.520
that palace woman mentioned
"13 tales" at the start.

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:50.990
But there are only 12 of us here.
What does she mean?

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:53.530
This is a story from
the previous emperor’s time.

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:57.240
Back then, the rear palace kept growing,

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:00.040
and new quarters
were constantly being added.

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.000
For what reason?

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:05.630
The Grand Empress Dowager,

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:08.590
who wielded immense power at that time,

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:13.050
was gathering girls to match
the emperor’s tastes.

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:16.680
What…?

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.260
The previous emperor

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:22.180
would choose young girls, barely of age,
and take their innocence.

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:25.230
The girls, once taken,

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:27.980
were never allowed to leave,

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:30.190
spending their days in confinement.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:34.700
One of them became pregnant

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:37.700
and pleaded with the emperor.

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:42.200
But she was never allowed
to leave the rear palace,

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:44.330
and just before she died,
she spoke her last words…

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:50.170
"Next… it will be your turn!"

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:52.760
Maomao!

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.760
No wonder my head feels foggy!

00:16:58.260 --> 00:16:59.850
Lady Yinghua, Shisui!

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:02.810
Move the weakened palace women
near the windows and doors!

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:05.020
What on earth is going on?

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.480
Hurry! The lingering flames are releasing

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:10.980
toxic air that's filling the room.

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:13.150
Got it!

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:20.450
I realized it too late…

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.370
And I was so close.

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:30.840
That palace woman…

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:38.760
Things got pretty chaotic, huh?

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.140
And the hostess disappeared too.

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:42.970
Maomao!

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:45.350
The girl from earlier…

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:47.190
She's an acquaintance of mine.

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:50.650
Hey, Maomao.
What was that story about earlier?

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:52.230
Earlier?

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:54.860
You know, the story
about the Forbidden Forest.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.280
The "Forbidden Forest"
is just a superstition,

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:04.580
but I can’t say for sure that
there’s no reason it became taboo.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.580
The forest is rich in food,

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:10.880
but it’s also full of things
that aren’t edible.

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:14.090
People from other lands would come,

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:17.720
eat things from the forest and fall ill.

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:22.050
And so, people started saying,
"You mustn’t eat anything

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:23.720
from the forest carelessly."

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:28.350
Over time, that became a forbidden rule.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.730
And when famines occurred later on,

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:35.280
people could no longer tell which foods
were safe and which were not.

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:39.910
The mother and child in that story were
starving during a year of poor harvest.

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:44.540
Since they were breaking the rules,
they must have entered the forest at dusk,

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:48.790
gathered food,
and returned home after nightfall.

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:51.460
There’s a mushroom called
"moonlight mushroom,"

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:53.960
a type of mushroom
that resembles oyster mushrooms.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.630
It looks very delicious,
but it's poisonous.

00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:59.050
And it has a unique trait,
it glows in the dark.

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:03.850
If a villager had seen
someone walking at night from afar,

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:06.060
they might have mistaken it
for a ghostly spirit.

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:09.100
The poison isn’t very strong,

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:12.980
but if a starving, weakened mother
and child ate it…?

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:21.070
Perhaps, in her final moments,
the mother wanted to say this…

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:26.160
"There are delicious mushrooms
in the forest…"

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:30.040
She meant to say that
as a way to get back at the villagers

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.080
who abandoned her and her child.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.540
So that’s what it was!

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:36.920
Yeah, now it all makes sense!

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.050
Well, I’m heading back this way!

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:44.720
Once you understand the truth behind it,
it's nothing special.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.930
I'm sure other stories have
similar hidden meanings too.

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:52.390
Well, who knows?

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.940
What do you mean by that?

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.650
I'm back.

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:01.570
Oh, that was quicker than I expected.

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:03.990
There was a bit of commotion.

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:05.620
Well, as expected…

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:09.330
When someone inexperienced
is in charge, things happen.

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:11.160
Inexperienced?

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:14.170
The palace woman who handled it
until last year passed away,

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:17.420
so I was worried about
who would take over this year.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:22.590
She was a very thoughtful and kind person.
I was taken care of by her too.

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:25.430
In the end, she never
got to leave the rear palace.

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:29.430
Actually, she was once favored
by the previous emperor,

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:32.640
and that gathering was
her only source of joy.

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:36.690
The fact that the gathering ceased
the year after she passed away,

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:38.770
I always found that rather unsettling.

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:42.280
I'm glad someone decided to continue it.

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:46.370
That story…

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:53.870
The previous emperor chose young girls,
barely of age, taking their innocence.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:58.290
The girls, once taken,
were never allowed to leave…

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:04.050
Was that palace woman's
story her own tale?

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:08.600
Or was it a cruel jest by someone
who knew the truth?

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:15.560
The world is full of things
we may never understand.

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:17.850
Tonight,

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:21.570
let's enjoy 13 chilling tales.

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:26.490
At that time, at that place,
even counting the elder palace woman,

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:28.570
there were only 12 people present.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.370
For now,

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:33.910
I'm glad we didn’t end up
becoming the 13th ghost story.

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:37.080
-Maomao!
-Yes?

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:41.000
Can I sleep with you tonight?!

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:48.640
Rather than a spine-chilling night,

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.680
it became a restless,
uncomfortable one instead…

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:55.350
-Too hot to bear.
-What is…this…?
