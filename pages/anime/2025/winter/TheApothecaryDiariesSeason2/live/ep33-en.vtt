THE APOTHECARY DARIES

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.950
‎THIS STORY IS A FICTION AND ALL NAMES OF FIGURES AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS.
MOREOVER, THE STORY HAS NO RELATION TO REAL-LIFE INCIDENTS AND EVENTS.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.850
That outbuilding will soon be demolished.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.180
So I would like you to investigate
before that happens.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.600
The curse that Lady Anshi spoke of.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.440
The reason the late emperor's body
remained unchanged from when he was alive.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.190
That is what I want you to uncover.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.950
It has been six years
since the late emperor passed.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.660
Once that outbuilding is gone, only
his tomb will remain to remind us of him.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.080
If the mystery remains unsolved,
Lady Anshi's heart will never be at peace.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.250
Understood. However, I have one request.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.590
A request?

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.840
May I enter the room

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.470
where the late emperor once resided?

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.930
You will have permission.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.470
It is said that
the emperor's consent is required,

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.700
Episode 33: The Late Emperor

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.020
but if the Empress Dowager intervenes,
there should be no issue.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.360
Maomao, your bed is ready.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.990
Thank you very much, Lady Suiren.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.780
Thank you for lending me a room.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.910
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.910
Surprisingly, she has rather cute taste.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.870
The couch would have been fine.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.620
I can't let you do that. It's been a while
since you've been in this wing.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.630
Please rest well.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.090
Yes.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.130
Lately, I've always been
at the Jade Pavilion.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.130
Honestly, I'm relieved
I don't have to go back tonight.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.310
I wonder how Lady Hongniang
would have reacted if I had seen her.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.140
Actually, I've been
getting off easy until now.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.890
An attendant who doesn't
belong to any specific palace

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.730
and shows up in other palaces...

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.900
That's not something the palace women
would find acceptable.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.950
Sometimes, I don't even understand
my own position.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.460
Reading next to candlelight...
how luxurious.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.420
Do you want to read something, Maomao?
You can go look in the back room.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.170
Books are precious.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.760
I should read whenever I get the chance.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.220
I hope there's something
that suits my taste.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.390
Wait for me!

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.560
Lady Suiren, you're actually quite young.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:00.690
Are you curious about that?

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.200
Rest assured.
I have no intention of stealing anything!

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.700
I know that.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.330
Is this a child's toy?

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.460
Yes, they were Lord Jinshi's favorites.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.290
Maomao, what do you think of Lord Jinshi?

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.500
Huh?

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.340
I think he's a good superior.

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:22.090
Mainly because he gives me rare medicines.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.760
Is there some hidden meaning in that?

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.930
Well, never mind.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.350
Because he always
wanted to play with this one,

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.810
I secretly hid it from him.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.060
But when I did, he cried uncontrollably.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.570
There are other toys, you know.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.990
No! I want that one!

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.570
Only that one will do!

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.080
Gaoshun struggled

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.950
to find a new toy
that would stop him from crying.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.580
Why did you take it away?

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.290
When someone becomes too attached to
one thing, they can't see anything else.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.800
He wasn't born into a position
where that was allowed.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.590
Whether he liked it or not,
he had to grow up quickly and act mature.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.100
That was his mother's wish.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.390
His mother's...

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.110
I've heard that growing up in a repressive
environment can affect the heart.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.070
Gradually, he began
to show his childish side.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.110
That too must be a part of
Lord Jinshi's true nature.

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.950
And yet, those around him
treat him as the beautiful eunuch.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.660
It's strange, isn't it?

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:41.420
This painting...

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.670
Oh, what's this doing here?

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.800
I was told to throw it away.

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:48.840
What was it?

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.180
May I touch this?

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.720
Go ahead.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.770
It's just a small stone.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.740
I wonder where he picked it up from.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.740
Did you take it away from him immediately?

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.370
Yes, a random stone
isn't exactly clean, is it?

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.370
That was the right call.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:16.500
It's poisonous.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.290
What do you mean?

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.540
That's what I'd like to ask.
Why was something like this lying around?

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.140
Did Lord Jinshi ever enter
the inner court as a child?

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.100
Yes,

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.220
occasionally...

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.140
But why does that matter?

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:38.890
I can't say anything for now...

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.400
I have a theory. But no proof yet.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.360
Lady Suiren, by tomorrow,
the Empress Dowager's so-called curse

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:52.370
and the reason why the late emperor's body
didn't decay will become clear.

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.240
Can you wait until then?

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.380
Even Lord Jinshi is involved now.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.880
I didn't want to make this a big deal.

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:19.270
This smell... It's not just mold.

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:29.530
A brush with evenly flattened bristles...
As I suspected.

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:33.410
Did the late emperor
have a hobby of painting?

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:38.450
Just once, he painted something for me.

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:42.870
He said it was a secret just between us.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.290
That if anyone found out,
it would be taken away.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.800
Is he getting flustered?
That's Lord Jinshi's habit.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.260
He is pretending to be calm.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:59.310
I don't know much about
the late emperor, nor do I wish to.

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:02.770
But to uncover the truth
behind this curse, I need evidence.

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:11.280
Did the late emperor
always paint in this room?

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.400
I'm not sure about that,

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:16.450
but from the time
he began secluding himself here,

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:18.280
one individual had been accompanying him.

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:20.240
Can you call that person here?

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:23.540
I believe they still work here.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:24.790
I'll call them.

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:29.500
May I touch it?

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:30.590
Go ahead.

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:35.930
It's stiffer than I expected.

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.850
And it has a distinct smell.

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:42.060
There are translucent fragments
on the floor.

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:45.270
And stains that look like someone
tried desperately to wipe them away.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:47.270
And those stains...

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.770
They increase the closer
you get to the wall.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:58.200
It's soft. Layers of thick paper
seem to be pasted here.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.750
It's coated,
perhaps to reinforce the surface.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:06.210
I had a general idea about the curse,

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:09.290
but now, I might uncover something
seemingly insignificant as well.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.210
I've brought them here.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.220
You are...?

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.600
He seem quite old for someone entrusted
with the room of a person of high status...

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.810
I have something to ask you.

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.020
This person is a former slave.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:30.650
And also, he cannot speak.

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:32.530
I see.

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:33.860
So that's how it is, huh?

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:38.530
It's not uncommon to choose
a servant who cannot speak.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.370
Especially for someone of high status
who is constantly under watch.

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:46.500
Then, just nod or shake your head
and that will be enough.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.290
Were there any paintings in this room?

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:53.170
I believe there was something...

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:57.930
So, he won’t even bother listening
to what a young girl has to say?

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:00.930
No, that's not it.

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:03.890
Is he hiding something?

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:08.270
Is there something on the wall?

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.570
May I remove this wallpaper?

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.780
It’s as if he's telling me not to.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:20.990
I don't mind.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.040
It's going to be destroyed anyway.

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.700
If it helps to uncover something,
please do it.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.340
Carefully...

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.480
This painting...

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.190
What is that?

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.780
It must have been
painted by the late emperor.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.200
I have no interest
in the emperor's character.

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.820
Because he stood
at the pinnacle of the nation,

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:06.700
he likely died without ever being able
to fully utilize his true talent.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.710
That talent resides in this painting.

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:14.500
The color of the robe
this woman is wearing...

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:18.960
I believe it's made from pigment ground
from orpiment stone.

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:24.300
Orpiment shares the same properties
as arsenic.

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:29.180
And arsenic has a preservative effect,
preventing decay.

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:35.480
At first, I thought that the orpiment used
in the wallpaper or something similar

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.730
was unknowingly absorbed
into his body over time.

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:40.070
That's what I thought.

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.860
But after seeing
the shape of the brush in this room,

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:46.450
another possibility emerged.

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:50.040
He must have been
using pigment made from orpiment.

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:53.080
The arsenic contained in the orpiment

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:57.090
was likely absorbed gradually
into the late emperor's body.

00:11:57.170 --> 00:12:01.010
By the time of his death, it must have
spread throughout his entire body.

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:05.050
He continued painting in secret,

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:06.600
right here in this room.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:11.560
For an emperor to engage in painting, such
a thing would be considered unthinkable.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.060
At least that's how people
around him would see it.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.770
That's why, even if he was called a fool,

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:19.570
the late emperor never made it public.

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:23.610
It was likely for that reason
he entrusted the care of this room

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.070
to a mute slave servant.

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.280
There's still some resilience left.

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:30.040
Just how many layers lie beneath this?

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.120
With so many paintings,

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:35.290
the one who prepared
the materials was likely...

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.960
the Empress, the late emperor's mother.

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:40.800
The woman in this painting must have known

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:45.800
that her own child
was not fit to be emperor.

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:50.600
So, to protect her son who had stumbled
upon the imperial throne by chance,

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.810
she gathered power under herself.

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:57.310
Even if it meant being called
the Empress in her own right.

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:01.730
The empress,
who did everything for her child,

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.320
ultimately granted him this room...

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.780
and the tools to paint with.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:06.740
Unaware they were poisonous.

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:10.620
What an irony.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
That is all I can say.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.880
You've done more than enough.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:36.190
It's as if she's questioning someone
far beyond the azure sky.

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:39.940
How sentimental I've become.

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:54.950
How irritating.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.040
Even though it's faded,

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:04.880
his presence remains overwhelming.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.550
Am I within this painting too?

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:13.060
No, in the end, I am merely...

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.890
a fleeting existence passing by.

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:20.690
It is only thanks to the scars left here

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:23.400
that I now stand
as the Mother of the Nation.

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:27.700
By chance,
I fell into the late emperor's hands

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.910
and conceived a child.

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.740
There were voices that pitied such a girl.

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:35.200
Surely, such girls did exist.

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:40.210
But I had known of
the emperor's perversions from the start.

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:44.800
My father was a civil official,
and my mother, a concubine.

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:49.010
And though my face was youthful,
I matured early.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.220
And my father used me
as a convenient tool.

00:14:56.890 --> 00:15:00.140
I entered the rear palace as an attendant
to a mid-ranking consort.

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:03.190
That consort was my half-sister.

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:06.190
She was raised with
the utmost care and affection.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.110
She had no way of knowing
our father's true intentions.

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:12.160
Hey, Anshi! Hurry up
and put on the ornaments for me!

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.410
Yes, Sister.

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:20.790
At last, tonight, His Majesty will come...

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:22.960
I caught a glimpse of him
from afar the other day...

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.840
He was truly a beautiful man.

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:27.960
Is that so?

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:32.220
We have been expecting you.

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.350
Please, come in.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.980
Get away!

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.570
Emperor!

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:56.200
That figure...

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:59.950
hardly seemed worthy of
standing atop the nation.

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.710
As an attendant, I should have
either comforted the consort

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:06.210
or apologized for
any disrespect toward the Emperor.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:07.800
Yet...

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.520
Are you alright?

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:28.770
The Emperor's eyes...

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:32.110
certainly caught sight of me.

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:36.320
The eyes of a girl brimming with ambition.

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.920
I bore the late Emperor's child

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.750
and faced death's shadow countless times.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.250
I was fortunate that my child was a boy,

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:53.550
and the Empress acknowledged
the child as her grandson.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:56.550
"There, there..."

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.140
"Yes, yes."

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:03.140
There was once a woman
who bore a daughter.

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:06.520
She claimed the girl was
the late Emperor's child,

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.520
but the Emperor denied
any knowledge of her.

00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:10.730
The medical officer accused of
being the father,

00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:12.900
was exiled along with the child.

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:17.950
At that time, only medical officers were
spared from castration in the rear palace.

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:21.410
But from then on,
even they were forced to undergo it.

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:24.910
The one who performed
surgery on my abdomen...

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.420
How pitiful that
such cruel misfortune befell him.

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:32.840
The woman who gave birth to a daughter
remained alone in the rear palace.

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:36.430
She would never leave the palace
for the rest of her life.

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:39.800
Time passed even further...

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:43.720
When I no longer appeared as a young girl,

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:45.930
the late Emperor never came to see me.

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:49.610
It seems the court ranks
will expand again.

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:52.820
Yes. I heard that Lord Shishou
proposed it.

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:54.690
I see.

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:57.610
The rear palace kept growing larger,

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:00.990
and young girls burdened
with the same fate as mine

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.450
kept arriving, one after another.

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:18.130
Existing solely
as a puppet of the Empress,

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:21.680
he was a pathetic man who could only

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:23.930
converse properly with young girls.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.320
To be forgotten by someone like that...

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:42.830
I couldn't forgive him!

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:48.080
Are you afraid of me?

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:53.290
Is it because I've become a grown woman?

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.340
Or is it...

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:57.970
this scar on my stomach?

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:03.140
I tormented the man who trembled,
begging for forgiveness in the bedchamber.

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:07.020
The young girls who had
been touched by him.

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.640
And his great mother, the Empress.

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:13.150
I wanted to imprint memories of myself
onto him more than them.

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:16.150
After that, the late emperor

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:19.820
broke his spirit,
and withdrew into that room.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.910
No one felt the urge
to question the reason.

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:27.240
In the end,

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:30.460
that man probably only
pictured the Empress, his mother,

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:34.330
and those ambitionless daughters
in these pictures.

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:38.550
Just once,

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:40.550
he painted me.

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:43.430
Even though

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:45.800
I once cherished that painting dearly,

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:47.760
I told Suiren to throw it away.

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:49.810
"I don't need it," I said.

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:53.650
Just as I wasn't needed by him.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:05.870
Long ago, the late emperor
once came to see us, didn't he?

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:09.370
Yes, I wonder how many years ago that was.

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.830
At that time,
I picked up something like this.

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:15.460
They say this is orpiment.

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:17.840
This stone...

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:21.590
This morning,
Suiren finally returned it to me.

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:24.260
I see...

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.600
Even if they call it
an illegitimate child,

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.850
or say it was a child switched at birth,

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.520
there's no doubt
it's still a precious child.

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:39.980
Once, I think I saw one of his paintings.

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:44.490
It was softly-colored,
depicting a young girl.

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:48.990
I must have picked up this stone
because I remembered that painting.

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:51.910
Even though I said to throw it away.

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:56.420
In the past, you used to like
wearing this color, didn't you?

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:17.520
It's just a coincidence.

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:21.940
Is the woman in that painting
really the Empress?

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:26.910
What was he trying to convey back then?

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:33.750
I don't know.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.380
I chose not to find out.

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:42.050
More importantly, you...

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:45.130
It seems you've taken quite
an interest in an intriguing attendant.

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:49.550
She's quite useful.

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:52.350
Indeed. But...

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:56.350
I know that's not all there is to it.

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:04.070
I've been watching you for years.

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:10.070
If you don't keep your favorites hidden,

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:13.200
someone will hide them from you.
