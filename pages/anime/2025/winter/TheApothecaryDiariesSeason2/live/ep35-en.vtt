THE APOTHECARY DARIES

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.520
‎THIS STORY IS A FICTION AND ALL NAMES OF FIGURES AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS.
MOREOVER, THE STORY HAS NO RELATION TO REAL-LIFE INCIDENTS AND EVENTS.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.020
If you're going to dilute
the bloodline at this point,

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.730
why not incorporate someone like her?

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.940
If you don't keep your favorites hidden,

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.280
someone will hide them from you.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.240
Good morning, Lord Jinshi.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.660
Are the preparations
for tomorrow complete?

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.450
Yes, everything is in order.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.410
Then, the only problem that remains
is that girl.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.630
If she is to accompany us
on the expedition,

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.250
it will be difficult
to keep it hidden from her.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.000
I know.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.630
I intend to tell the apothecary myself
during this expedition.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.970
The truth about my identity.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.560
Maomao! You're being called.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.310
Excuse me.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.690
Lady Gyokuyou,
is there something you need?

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.820
It's not me who needs something…

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.280
It's me.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.780
And what would that be?

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.160
I would like you to
"return" her to me for a few days.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.910
Return?

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.540
Now that I think about it, I was
only allowed to return to Jade Pavilion

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.380
as a special arrangement
until Lady Gyokuyou's childbirth was over.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.590
Well, that's troublesome.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.930
Who will handle
the poison tasting in the meantime?

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.970
I shall lend you one of my attendants.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.890
-Can she be trusted?
-Of course.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.310
A few days, you say?
Are you going somewhere?

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.570
I received an invitation to a hunt
from someone I cannot refuse.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.900
Someone you cannot refuse?

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.650
An invitation from Lord Shishou.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.240
It must be tough, dealing with
all these social obligations.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.910
So, you're saying you want to
"borrow" my Maomao?

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.200
Yes.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.040
I was hoping you could "return" her to me.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.500
Does it have to be Maomao?

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.330
I have plenty of other capable girls here.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.710
No, as long as you return her,
that will suffice.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.130
Well… which girl are you referring to?

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.680
I mean… her.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.930
You keep saying "her" and nothing else.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.930
Is that a problem?

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.560
-Gaoshun.
-Yes?

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.650
What do you call Maomao?

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.900
I call her Xiaomao.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.450
And what do you call Maomao?

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.830
Oh… come to think of it,
he's never called me by my name.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.120
Not that I mind.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.630
Why is Lord Jinshi acting so restless?

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.220
Lady Gyokuyou's approval was granted

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.510
30 minutes later.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.220
Episode 35: The Hunt

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:33.770
LI

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.900
The country name "Li,"

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.150
that single character embodies
the story of its founding.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.120
There are three swords beneath the grass.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.740
The "grass" represents "flower,"

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.490
referring to Empress Wang Mu,
the ancestor of the Emperor.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.370
And the three swords beneath it symbolize

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.330
the three warriors who aided
the Empress Wang Mu.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.250
The larger of the three swords,
compared to the bottom two,

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.380
represents the northern lands
of Shihoku Province.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.090
The Shihoku region cultivates
sorghum and barley.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.310
And if you go further north,
you'll find vast mountainous terrain…

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:07.850
Hey, are you listening?

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.890
My apologies, Lord Basen.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.440
I'm explaining the place
we're heading to, you know?

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.320
-It's in the north…
-It's Shihoku Province!

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.110
The land governed by Lord Shishou's clan,

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.530
the very one who invited
Lord Jinshi on this hunt.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.700
So they called him over

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.700
under the pretext of a hunt,
right into their own domain.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.040
Though the Emperor himself didn't attend,

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.250
the guest list is still
quite distinguished.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.550
Why would my father
choose a girl like this?

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.960
"Father," huh?

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.630
It seems Lord Basen is the son
of Lord Gaoshun.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.260
This time, he has been invited
as a guest separate from Lord Jinshi

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.640
and is acting as an attendant
in Lord Gaoshun's place.

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.690
Even if he's a eunuch, that doesn't mean
he was always "without" it from birth.

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.110
Considering his age, it wouldn't be
surprising if he had children…

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.570
We're almost there.

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.540
This high-altitude and cool climate land…

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.290
The previous Emperor used to visit

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.040
this place every year as a summer retreat.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.880
Since the current emperor took the throne,
no imperial family members have visited,

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.050
but it seems that
Lord Shishou's clan manages it.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.680
So we're staying here?

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.570
This room is oddly hot.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.360
Still… just what is that relaxed posture?

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.660
He must be more exhausted than usual,
but this is a bit too much.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.370
Is that a mask?

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.290
Does he need a mask for long journeys

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.290
because he's so beautiful?

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:00.840
How should I address you here?

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.760
When we're indoors,
address me as you usually do.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.880
When we're outside, call me Kousen.

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.010
Understood, Lord Kousen.

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:09.600
Huh?

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.850
Something on your mind?

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.730
Well…

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:24.240
Lord Gaoshun has also been invited
as a guest of honor, correct?

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:25.900
That's right.

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:27.490
In that case,

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.280
why were they placed in the same building?

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:34.000
Given their positions, there should be
a greater distinction between them.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.410
The Ma clan has,

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.170
for generations,
served Lord Kousen's family.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.330
Being in the same building
is only natural!

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:41.880
I see…

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.550
So, Lord Jinshi really is from
an esteemed background, after all.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.550
Father, what does this mean?

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.350
Could this girl possibly…

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.980
Xiaomao knows nothing about that matter.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:08.200
In time, Lord Jinshi will
tell her personally.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.200
Until then, do not mention it.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.200
But still… Don't you think--

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.580
Ouch…

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.200
What are they doing?

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.500
For now, I should at least
unpack my things.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:24.250
If I don't do some work,
Lady Suiren will scold me later.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:37.100
Outside, the banquet is in full swing,

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:40.390
so why are we holed up
in this closed-off room?

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:42.770
Excuse me,

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.400
wouldn't it be better to
at least open a window?

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.730
No need to.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.360
For now, try tasting
the evening meal for poison.

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:51.700
You will know if you do.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.620
Is this… soft-shelled turtle?

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.580
So it seems.

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.420
The aperitif tries to mask itself
with the sweetness of the fruit juice,

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.130
but it's actually quite strong.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.630
From the side dishes to the dessert…

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:11.720
How should I put it?

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.100
Everything seems
to be food meant to boost stamina.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.310
Now you understand, don't you?

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.430
Preserved food?

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:21.440
Aren't you going to eat?

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.310
There's no poison in it.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.270
Even if there's no poison,
it's not something I'd eat.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.780
Then, since leaving
it would be suspicious,

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.900
may I have it instead?

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:32.910
Do as you please.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:44.710
-Is that stuff good?
-It's delicious.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:47.380
I think everything aside from
the soft-shelled turtle is tasty too.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.840
Are you sure you don't want any?

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.920
Can I eat it?

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.510
It was originally meant for you.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.430
Are you really okay with it?

00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:58.430
What's with him?

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.730
I'm fine. Basen, go ahead and eat.

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:06.020
Are you sure?

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:07.940
I insist.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.280
Well then…

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.160
-It's delicious.
-I'm glad.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.540
-But…
-But?

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.790
Why is this girl completely unfazed?!

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.590
If you ask why…

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.000
It's just how my body is.

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:33.840
F… Forgive me. I'll return to my room…

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.550
Being young certainly
comes with its challenges.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:40.310
What should we do?

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:44.100
Let him sleep here.
I'll sleep in his room.

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:45.980
I can carry him to his room.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:47.770
But you must be exhausted.

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:50.690
If you say so…

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:54.570
The guards will use my room.

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.910
-So, Xiaomao, you can use this room.
-Understood.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:05.580
Being able to take a bath too.
How luxurious…

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.840
Tomorrow is the hunt, huh?

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:14.510
Hopefully, everything goes smoothly.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.600
Is this it? It's quite small.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:24.730
It's the latest model.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.900
Both range and accuracy have improved.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:30.440
With this, you can aim even in the forest.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.480
Here…

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:35.190
That person will die.

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:44.160
The hunt takes place on a high plateau,
a 30-minute horseback ride from the lodge,

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:47.870
followed by an hour-long trek
up the mountain.

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:52.710
It seems the nobles will have their prey
cooked on-site.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.640
There's nothing to do…

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.640
Maybe I'll take a walk.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.820
This forest is quite nice.

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:16.190
It looks like a good place
for medicinal herbs and mushrooms to grow…

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:22.780
Is there a large waterfall nearby?

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.750
You're such a good boy!

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:27.910
That is…

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:33.170
-Hello.
-Hello?

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.300
Young lady!

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:37.670
What are you doing here?

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.430
-I was summoned for something.
-I see.

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:45.720
Actually, me too. I was
specifically assigned as a guard, but…

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:48.270
they told me to take care of the dog.

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:51.520
Lord Lihaku also received
a special assignment,

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.650
but being from the countryside,

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:55.860
he was probably kicked out by the other,

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:57.780
more arrogant guards.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.780
He seems to be rising
in rank rapidly lately,

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.780
but that means he'll face more opposition.

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.780
You're bad at whistling.

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:06.870
Shut up.

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:09.710
It's fine. I've got this.

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:17.090
He's smart.

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:19.760
Right? Depending on the situation,

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.380
they can come running from miles away.

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:23.720
I see.

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:28.470
A dog petting another dog…

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.980
Even though this is a summer retreat,

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:40.860
the weather is nice,
but it's sweltering hot today.

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:44.200
Staying comfortable is no easy task.

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:50.120
In this sweltering heat, he's keeping
that mask on the whole time

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.210
and not even touching the food?

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:57.380
No matter how suspicious
a masked person looks,

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.170
if they're seated at the highest position,

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.470
it means they're
the most important guest here.

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:07.510
That's the father of Queen Loulan,
Lord Shishou.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.720
He's the ruler of Shihoku Province
and the host of this hunt.

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:14.230
Did he offend Lord Jinshi?

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:19.150
Would that overly-courteous eunuch

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:21.900
really show such a blatant attitude?

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:25.910
Could it be… because of the heat?

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:29.790
Is he saying,
"Don't do anything right now"?

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.380
-Xiaomao.
-Yes?

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:47.850
-May I have this?
-Ah, sure.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.020
Jin…

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:00.940
Lord Kousen.

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:07.070
-It's you.
-Please take this off.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.870
No.

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:10.950
There's no one around.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.910
Someone might come.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.410
Ugh, how annoying!

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:18.130
If you're that worried about being seen,

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:20.630
why not go somewhere out of sight?

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:31.010
Excuse me, I'll wipe your face.

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:35.140
He's burning hot. He's overheated.

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:36.600
I need to give him the water I brought.

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:38.480
Apothecary…

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.360
There's something I need to tell you.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.020
Right now?

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:45.360
I knew I had to say it someday.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.620
I… the truth is…

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.120
What?

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.540
The smell of sulfur…?

00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:58.790
Was that a gun?

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:02.040
-Sorry.
-Huh?

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:03.880
This is going to be a bit of a scare.

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:09.800
A bit? Are you kidding me!

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:16.480
Should we look in the waterfall basin?

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.230
At this height,
they wouldn't have survived anyway.

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:21.560
More importantly, hide the gun.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.380
I didn't know you couldn't swim.
I'm sorry.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:49.430
How could I swim… in that?

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:50.340
There's no way.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:56.220
Jumping off a nearly 50-meter cliff…
What a reckless move.

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:58.680
I thought you had lost your mind.

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:01.770
The waterfall basin here is deep,

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:05.230
so if you jump properly, you won't die,
unless you drown.

00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:07.740
Yeah. Unless you drown.

00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:19.040
-What are you--!
-I apologize for my unsightly appearance.

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.170
But if I stay like this, I'll catch cold.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.880
I suppose I shouldn't take off
the apron and waistcloth.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:31.470
Even if my ribs look pitiful,
I'd rather cover up what I can.

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:37.010
I'll wring out yours as well,
Lord Jinshi, so could you take them off?

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:46.320
I'll do it myself!

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.820
Give me yours too. I'm stronger than you.

00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:56.990
I'm glad. He seems to be
feeling better than before.

00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:59.540
Though he seems to be in a bad mood.

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:03.290
The medicinal herbs are no longer usable.

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:05.040
Is there anything else I can use?

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:10.960
Lord Jinshi.

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:15.720
-What is it?
-I apologize for offering you this.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.010
But would you like to have some?

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:19.720
Is it some kind of medicine?

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:22.430
It's butterbur that was served
in the morning meal.

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:25.060
I brought it as a snack,

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:28.770
but right now,
you seem to be lacking salt.

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:30.280
Salt?

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.780
When I was chasing after you,

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:35.070
I brought water mixed with salt and sugar,

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.870
but I left it up by the waterfall.

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:41.120
Anyways, going out hunting
with your face covered,

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.500
without eating or drinking anything,
will take a toll on your body.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.040
Weren't you having headaches

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:49.040
due to the heat and dehydration?

00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:01.010
Your dizziness from overheating
seems to have subsided,

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.310
but just in case, please take some salt.

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:06.150
If that's the case…

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:10.770
It's not as bad as I expected.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.110
You eat some too.

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:21.120
Thank you, I will.

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:28.790
What on earth was that earlier?

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.500
-It was a gun.
-Gun?

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:35.130
A weapon that uses gunpowder for warfare.

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:38.220
It requires preparation after each shot.

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:39.640
Yet, without pause,

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.930
two shots were fired.

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:45.640
Does that mean
there were multiple shooters?

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:50.400
At least two. There may have been more.

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:54.900
Who on earth is holding
a grudge against you and why?

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:07.370
Lord Jinshi, do you know
a way out of here?

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:10.210
Besides swimming, that is.

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:11.750
There's a hole in the ceiling in the back.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:15.210
Does Lord Gaoshun know about that?

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:16.800
He might not.

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:20.720
Basen does, but I'm not sure
if he'll notice right away.

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:33.610
What if we shout for help
towards the hole?

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:35.860
Unless someone is really close,
they won't hear us.

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:38.320
If we shout all day long,

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.610
someone might eventually notice, but…

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:44.950
-What was that?
-It's nothing…

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:49.370
It's high up, but if one of us acts
as a foothold, maybe we can reach it.

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:54.210
If Lady Suiren finds out I used
Lord Jinshi as a stepping stool…

00:20:57.170 --> 00:21:00.220
-If you act as a foothold, you'll crumble.
-But…

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:01.470
Get on me!

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:08.390
You should put on some weight.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.190
Now is not the time for that.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.360
It's slippery and damp,

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.780
but if I hook my fingers…

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.650
-I'm going to stand.
-Alright!

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:32.580
What? A frog?

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:38.170
-Hey!
-Whoa!

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:47.220
I'm not… hurt?

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.650
My apologies, Lord Jinshi!
