Episode 32: The Empress Dowager

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.390
Starting today, this will be your room.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.900
A storage shed...?

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.860
You're seriously telling me to live here?

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.230
Yes. Reflect on your actions.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.160
Lady Yinghua, are you alright?

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.990
Of course not!

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.750
Collecting all that junk!
You're unbelievable.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.630
At this rate, Lady Hongniang
will kick you out of your room

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.500
and you'll be banished
to the storage shed!

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.670
That sounds great.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.010
The storage shed is bigger than
my current room.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.260
And even if I make noise at night...

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.930
- Maomao?
- Not bad.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.560
Now that it's decided, let's hurry.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.980
I need to get back quickly
and ask Lady Hongniang about this.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.520
Wait. Hey... wait!

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:41.740
What is all this...?

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.580
Make sure you reflect properly.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.040
Lady Hongniang...

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.250
Thank you so much!

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.750
I'll dry medicinal herbs here!
And I'll prepare medicines here!

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.170
This goes there, and that goes here...!

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.800
See? I told you it’s pointless!

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.550
The storage shed? Unbelievable.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.770
Isn't telling Lady Hongniang

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.180
a bit too much, Yinghua?

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.480
It wasn’t me!

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.820
Maomao asked Lady Hongniang herself.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.360
Right, Maomao?

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.940
Yes. It was quite convenient for me
in many ways.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.450
What?

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:23.870
That aside,

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.120
Maomao, you need to stop
collecting bugs, okay?

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.370
Bugs?

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.660
Actually, I'm collecting lizard tails...

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.670
And besides, I haven't collected any
since Lady Yinghua collapsed.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.880
Really?

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.760
But there's a rumor going around that
a strange court lady is catching bugs

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.130
while laughing.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.800
I've done no such thing.

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.310
I did collect moths for a job,

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.310
but I never laughed while catching bugs...

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.110
This is a serious matter.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.110
Huh? Did I see Shisui lately?

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.070
Yeah. Have you seen Shisui around lately?

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.280
Shisui, huh?

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.450
That girl is always vanishing
and reappearing out of nowhere.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.340
Hey, hey! Does anyone know
where Shisui is?

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.920
Shisui?

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.380
I might've seen her... or maybe not.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.760
Huh? Where did you see her? Tell me!

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.180
Well...

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.890
Is she wary because
I'm the attendant assigned to the consort?

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.560
Someone like Xiaolan,

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.480
who treats everyone equally,
is actually pretty rare.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.360
Maybe I can bait them with something.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.240
Oh, this might work...

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.030
Depending on
how detailed your information is,

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.540
I might just give this to you.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.450
Use it. You're bleeding.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:58.880
This is...

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.340
Could it possibly belong to that person?

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.840
I'll leave it to your imagination.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.470
Now, would you mind
telling me her whereabouts?

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.180
From what they told me,

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.600
she's often seen in the northern thicket...

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.230
Come to think of it,
I ran into her around here before.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.520
Perhaps this is her favorite spot.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.330
I should've brought some
mosquito repellent.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:32.830
Marvel-of-Peru...

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.410
So they were growing here.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.880
I remember when I was little,
I used to go pick their seeds

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.630
with the courtesans.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.130
However the powder inside wasn't used
as face powder,

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.050
but to make an abortion pill.

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.180
Shin originally didn't wear perfume.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.520
Shin, who was trying to replace
Lady Lihua as a consort,

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.400
avoiding a pregnancy risk is not strange.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:03.860
But despite that,

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.150
Shin deliberately wore perfume
while trying to make an abortion pill.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.740
Which means...

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.320
It's not as if only Lady Gyokuyou

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.450
receives the Emperor's favor.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.250
It's entirely possible that
Lady Lihua is pregnant as well.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.250
But the strange part about
that incident isn't just that.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.090
The abortion pill made by the courtesans,
aside from Marvel-of-Peru flowers,

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.510
can also be made with
Chinese lantern plants, peonies, balsam,

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.140
as well as quicksilver.

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:34.850
Leaving quicksilver aside,

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.980
the rest are flowers that can be
obtained within the rear palace.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.480
And yet,

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.980
Shin sourced the ingredients
for the abortion pill

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.150
from supplies brought in by the caravan.

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.440
In other words,
someone must have taught Shin,

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.530
who had no knowledge of medicine,
how to make poison.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.490
And that person is likely
still within the rear palace...

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.960
Gotcha!

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.170
Wait, wait, wait!

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.760
Being lumped together
with someone like that...

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:09.800
That's just insulting.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.930
Gotcha!

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:21.940
A bug!

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:26.400
Shisui...

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.940
I’d appreciate it
if you could move your hands.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.530
- Sorry, Maomao.
- Whatever.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.410
- Were you trying to catch those bugs?
- Yes.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.120
She must really like bugs.

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:54.390
This bug lives on
an island nation in the East,

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:56.140
and it makes sounds
by rubbing its wings together.

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:59.350
It probably escaped
from some traded goods.

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:00.930
Like that moth I caught before,

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.850
it likely only exists here.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.690
It kind of looks like a cockroach,

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:06.400
but it’s different, so don’t worry.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.320
And you know,
I have so much more to tell you!

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.030
I shouldn't have asked.

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:16.410
What’s that sound?

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:28.340
That’s the Empress Dowager, isn’t it?

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.800
I saw her at last year’s garden party,
but she looks so young.

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.390
Hard to believe she’s
the Emperor’s mother.

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:39.350
Why are you hiding?

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:40.850
You are too, Maomao.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.600
A reflex, I guess...

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:46.190
Is she going to the clinic?

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:48.520
- The clinic?
- Yeah.

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.650
It's an unofficial clinic
run by the court ladies.

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:53.400
I know about that.

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:56.610
They say the Empress Dowager
established it.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:57.780
The Empress Dowager?

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:01.200
It was during a time when
the Empress Regnant's power was strong,

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:03.410
so it seems she couldn’t
set it up officially.

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:05.500
I see.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.040
The Empress Dowager is kind, isn’t she?

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.720
Plus, the ban on eunuchs and slavery...

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.350
I heard that was due to
her influence as well.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.390
From a humanity perspective,

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:25.730
abolishing slavery is a good thing.

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:29.860
But putting aside
those treated like livestock,

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:33.860
cases where maids use themselves
as collateral for debt

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.700
are considered legally similar
to employment.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.240
Still, from an outsider’s view,

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.830
there’s little difference between
a maid and a slave.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:46.790
Granny said she was really nervous
when the abolition was decided.

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:49.670
Officially, slavery has been abolished,

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:53.670
but it’s common knowledge that
it still exists under a different name.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:57.340
Well then, I should be heading back soon.

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:01.140
Maomao, if you keep wandering around
too much, won’t you get scolded?

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:03.810
Yeah, but...

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:07.690
The Empress Dowager
is heading to the clinic.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.100
Could it be related to

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:11.810
the Crystal Pavilion incident
from the other day?

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:14.690
If the Empress Dowager
is getting involved,

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:18.490
there might be reform
in the palace’s medical system.

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.450
I’d love to hear more about that, but...

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.410
- Yeah, I’d better go home.
- Huh?

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.790
I’ve been making people mad lately...

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.540
Do it again!

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:32.790
Yes...

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:35.250
This is the third time.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:39.130
I was starting to think she finally
started picking on me...

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.510
- Clean more thoroughly!
- Yes!

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:43.260
- There!
- Yes!

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:45.640
The other attendants
are getting criticized too.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:49.440
Clean more thoroughly than usual!
Not a speck of dust should be left behind.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.900
Huh? Is someone coming?

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.610
It’s been a while, Lady Anshi.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.410
It’s the Empress Dowager!

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:07.330
Have you been well?

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.960
Thank you for your concern.

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:14.210
Does the Empress Dowager know about
Lady Gyokuyou's pregnancy?

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.710
So that must mean
that she’s really trusted.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:24.680
Rather than a mother-in-law
and daughter-in-law,

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:28.140
they are more like friends
with a bit of an age gap.

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:30.140
You...

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:34.560
You’re the attendant Jinshi assigned,
aren’t you?

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:36.900
Yes, that’s right.

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:38.070
How does she know that?

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:40.650
Suiren told me.

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:44.160
She said a girl worth training
has returned to the rear palace.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.410
Suiren used to be my attendant
a long time ago.

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:50.620
I see.

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:52.920
So that sly attendant
and the Empress Dowager

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.080
were old acquaintances.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.630
Lady Anshi,

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:05.550
pardon me, but Lingli seems tired.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.720
May I put her to bed?

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.520
Yes. Go ahead.

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:16.400
She's quite perceptive.

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:18.270
She really is.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.700
Now, have a seat over here.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.450
Yes.

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:27.200
You know,

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.540
I hear you’ve been solving
all sorts of problems.

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:36.210
I’m just applying the knowledge I have

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:39.210
to situations where it fits.

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:44.430
Did that sound negative?

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:45.760
But really,

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.890
I don’t have a wild imagination,

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:49.890
nor do I have my father’s vast knowledge.

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:53.770
I can’t stay calm
unless I tell them upfront.

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:57.400
That’s just my principle. I can’t help it.

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:03.240
That’s fine.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.990
Just tell me what you can understand.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.040
I want you to investigate something.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.290
Did I...

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:23.340
place a curse on the late Emperor?

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.110
A curse, huh?

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:46.950
It’s not unreasonable to think that way.

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:49.570
To be honest, I’ve never heard

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:52.660
anything good about the previous Emperor.

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:56.620
A foolish brother, a dim-witted lord,
a puppet of the Empress Regnant.

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:59.290
But the most well-known thing
about him in the rear palace

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:00.960
was that he was attracted to young girls.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.010
Political marriages and settling debts

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:07.220
by taking young brides does happen.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.840
However, even though
there were plenty of women

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:12.010
of appropriate age in the selection,

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.720
he always chose the youngest girls.

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:18.770
The Empress Dowager bears
a scar on her stomach.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.270
When she gave birth
to the current Emperor,

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.780
her body was still not fully developed,

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:27.990
so she had no choice but
to have her stomach cut open.

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:31.490
And the one who was
forcibly made into a eunuch

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:33.580
just to assist in that childbirth

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:36.250
was my unfortunate father, Luomen.

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:39.040
Perhaps because of such sacrifices,

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.250
the current Emperor grew up healthy,

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.750
and the Empress Dowager later
gave birth to imperial younger brother.

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.210
If I remember correctly,
the imperial younger brother

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:49.130
is one year older than me.

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:52.760
When the Empress Dowager gave birth,
she was nearly 30.

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:55.760
She was far from being
considered a young girl.

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:58.020
If that’s the case...

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:03.020
Is the prince really
the former Emperor’s child?

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:07.740
If I were to say something like this
aloud, I’d probably be beheaded.

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:13.740
A few days later, the Empress Dowager

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:15.240
arranged a tea party,

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:18.250
bringing together
the four high-ranking consorts.

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:20.750
Lady Gyokuyou, this way.

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:23.500
There’s still some time
before the tea party begins,

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:25.340
so please take some rest.

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:27.500
Yes, I’ll do that.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.590
Lady Gyokuyou is still experiencing

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.510
the drowsiness typical of early pregnancy.

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:39.430
What is the Empress Dowager planning?

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.810
A tea party outside the rear palace?

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:44.610
Even if it’s outside,
it’s still within the inner court.

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:46.360
Plus, it’s His Majesty’s residence.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.110
That makes it even more nerve-wracking!

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:51.070
It’s not a place we usually enter.

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:53.030
The Empress Dowager is aware

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:55.120
that Lady Gyokuyou is pregnant,

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.280
so why do this now?

00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:58.330
That’s true,

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:01.000
I’m sure she’ll take
that into consideration, but...

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.330
When it comes to the other consorts,

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:06.380
who knows what they might do?

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:10.670
Lady Gyokuyou's pregnancy
is an open secret,

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.050
but in a face-to-face tea gathering,

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:15.890
they might openly
try to probe for information.

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:18.470
However, Lady Lihua

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.890
wouldn't ask any questions
that might implicate herself.

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.850
Besides, Lady Lihua, who has
always been proud and dignified,

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.690
would never try to disgrace someone else.

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:30.440
For Lady Gyokuyou as well,

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:33.200
it wouldn't be wise
to quarrel with Lady Lihua,

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.910
whose lineage is even more noble.

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:37.280
If anyone were to say something,

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:39.620
it would likely be Lady Lishu
who was tricked by her attendant.

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:43.410
But I don't think the head attendant,
a former poisoner, would do that.

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:46.710
If anything, the one to watch out for
is Lady Loulan.

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.550
Apart from her flashy attire,

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:51.880
there’s strangely little gossip about her.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.010
Maomao, do you have a moment?

00:16:58.720 --> 00:16:59.720
Yes.

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:05.190
What is it?

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:07.810
I’ll be the one tasting for poison today.

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:10.820
You understand what that means, right?

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:12.320
I understand.

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:17.740
For the Empress Dowager to host
a gathering without assigning

00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:18.820
a poison taster implies that

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:21.830
she trusts the attendees.

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:24.040
And as for you,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.920
the Empress Dowager
has requested your assistance.

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:31.840
Has another problem been brought to you?

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:38.090
Did I place a curse on the late Emperor?

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:39.800
If possible,

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:42.180
I’d prefer to have this conversation
somewhere else.

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:46.270
It doesn't matter.
I'm sure you can't tell me anyway.

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:47.310
However!

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:51.650
Make sure you don't do anything
to betray Lady Gyokuyou.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.990
I have no intention of making
you an enemy, Lady Hongniang.

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:02.660
Good.

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:05.370
I'd like to maintain a good relationship
with you too, Maomao.

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:07.830
That's true...

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:09.880
Lady Hongniang is

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:13.420
undoubtedly suited to being
Lady Gyokuyou’s head attendant.

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:21.890
If the Empress Dowager is calling for me,
it must be about that curse.

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:27.520
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:29.520
This way.

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:33.320
Before the current rear palace was built,

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.860
this place used to
serve as the rear palace.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.820
Is that so?

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.490
There’s no sign of people here,

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:44.030
yet it's spotless,
without even a speck of dust.

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:54.040
Even the raked gravel of
the dry landscape garden is clean.

00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:58.050
This is the place.

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:01.140
You may not go any further.

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:02.890
Even the cleaning staff

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:05.260
are not permitted beyond this point.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.940
What is this smell?

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:17.860
This room is...?

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.450
During the reign of
the emperor before last,

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:23.620
an attendant,

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.950
who became a consort
of lower rank, lived here.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.210
This was the room of the woman
known as the Late Empress Regnant,

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:34.080
the place where
the late emperor was raised,

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:35.840
and also where she passed away.

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:41.220
Let’s move to another location.

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.650
In his later years, the late emperor

00:19:57.730 --> 00:19:59.900
and his mother,
who was called the late Empress Regnant,

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:02.650
began spending more and more time
secluded in that room.

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:06.580
As if clinging to memories,
he immersed himself there.

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:08.830
Perhaps the late emperor
had grown weak in spirit,

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:11.000
because after the Empress Regnant
passed away,

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:14.330
he followed shortly after,
drawing his last breath in that room.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:18.880
Forgive me for asking,
but he wasn’t particularly young, was he?

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:22.090
He had lived a full life, so you
could say he passed away at an old age.

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:25.180
Then why does the Empress Dowager
believe it was a curse?

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:27.970
I, too, told her that there was

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.850
no such thing as a curse.

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:31.680
However, Lady Anshi said...

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:35.690
I cursed him. I wished he would disappear.

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:38.360
Night after night...

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.740
For so, so long... I kept thinking about it.

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:45.070
Is there

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.950
any actual proof
that a curse was involved?

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:53.210
The late emperor’s body

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:55.710
was enshrined in the mausoleum for a year.

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:59.040
The following year,
His Majesty and Lady Anshi viewed

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:00.710
the late emperor’s remains
before the burial.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.420
And when they saw his body...

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:06.640
it had remained

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:10.310
almost exactly the same
as when he had passed.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.100
In other words, it hadn't decayed?

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:19.020
Yes. The Empress Regnant, who passed away
around the same time...

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:22.400
Let's just say her remains were
in a state too horrific to describe.

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:25.280
And so, Lady Anshi

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.660
believes she herself placed
a curse on the late emperor.

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:28.870
Yes.

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:31.660
I see.

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:34.710
The mausoleum stays cool even in summer,

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:37.170
but unless a body is preserved in ice,

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:40.630
it will naturally decay, attract insects,
and dry up over time.

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:44.670
The fact that this didn’t happen
is certainly unusual.

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:47.840
All humans return to the earth.

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:50.600
Whether an aristocrat or a farmer,
it is the same.

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:53.020
No matter our social standing at birth,

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:55.180
this one fate is shared by all.

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:59.350
That wing of the palace is
set to be demolished soon.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:01.650
Before that happens,
I would like you to investigate it.

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:03.280
Understood.

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:06.900
But I have one request.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.490
A request?
