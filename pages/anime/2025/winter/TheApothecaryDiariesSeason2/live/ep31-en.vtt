THE APOTHECARY DARIES

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.850
‎THIS STORY IS A FICTION AND ALL NAMES OF FIGURES AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS.
MOREOVER, THE STORY HAS NO RELATION TO REAL-LIFE INCIDENTS AND EVENTS.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:46.770
Mother.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.160
Why did Mother have that expression?

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.750
Return to your room.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.050
That old man...

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:17.970
That old woman...

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.970
Who were they?

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.060
I can't remember clearly.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.780
What a terrible dream.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.710
Who were those old people?

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.000
At that time, I had no way of knowing.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.460
But later, I was told.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.010
The old man was my father,
and the old woman was my grandmother.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.510
And...

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.720
The man I had always thought
was my father,

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.010
turned out to be my brother.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.100
Even that slow-witted palace woman

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.650
should be realizing it by now.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.060
Or perhaps she already has.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.570
If so, that would be a relief.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.610
I can't stay silent forever.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.920
"Once upon a time, in this land,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.170
another people lived here.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.300
Episode 31: Shrine of Choosing

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.500
They had no ruler.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.170
But one day, a noble woman
from a distant land arrived,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.010
carrying within her womb
a child of the heavens.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.140
That child became the first emperor
of the Country of Li.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.060
The woman, who could see
even on moonless nights,

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.940
came to be called the Wang Mu.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.940
She was even said to be an immortal who
had descended from the celestial realm."

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.440
A founding legend of this country, huh?

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.070
What do you think, Apothecary?

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.570
Lord Jinshi, your face can be seen.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.370
I'm diligently studying here, and yet,

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.080
if such a creature is peeking in,
how can I concentrate?

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.830
Are there about 20 students?

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.380
I thought there would be more...

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.340
It started with just ten, so it has grown.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.090
Well, this is about right. That said...

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.300
If Lord Jinshi's plan succeeds,

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.520
and the literacy rate
of the maids improves,

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.930
It could change the very nature
of the rear palace.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.980
In fact, Xiaolan has now

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.150
progressed to the stage
where she can read simple stories.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.400
- My lord, it’s about time.
- Yes.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.860
What about you?

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.780
I'll stay and observe a little longer.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.290
I see. If anything catches
your attention, report it to me.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.580
Understood.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.290
Xiaolan.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.250
Maomao, you came?

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.300
How is it?
Have you learned some characters?

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.170
I still have a lot to learn.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.220
I need to ask the teacher something again.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.010
- Maomao, come with me.
- Oh...

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.850
The teacher is in the building next door.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.930
I go there sometimes to ask questions.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.560
An old shrine?

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.270
Excuse me.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.900
- Sorry to interrupt.
- Coming.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.610
That young lady over there
is a new face, isn't she?

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.790
A strangely long and narrow structure
that seems to stretch deep inside.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.460
The pillars are placed closely together.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.210
The rooms must be divided
into very small sections.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.340
Are you curious about that shrine?

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.050
Yes, I found its architecture
rather unusual.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.390
That shrine was built by the people

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.510
who originally lived in this land.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.930
When Queen Wang Mu
took control of this region,

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.560
she did not reject the old faiths.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.320
Is Queen Wang Mu the mother of
the first emperor we just learned about?

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.900
Yes. Queen Wang Mu told her son this,

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.700
"Anyone who rules this land

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.660
must pass through that shrine.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.700
And only those who choose the right path

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.660
shall become the ruler of this land."

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.290
Her son safely passed through the shrine,

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.210
and thus became the emperor.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.760
The reason the capital was relocated to
this place was because of that shrine.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:27.840
I see!

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.930
However, it hasn't been used
for decades now.

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.720
Whether it will be used again
in the future, who knows?

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.100
What do you mean by that?

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.350
The previous emperor’s older brothers

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.690
all perished due to a widespread illness.

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:45.230
The only one left was
the previous emperor.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.950
So the decision was made without
the need for the passage ritual.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.990
I'm glad to see someone
interested in that place.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.280
It's been quite some time
since that happened.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.290
Were there people who used to take
an interest in it before?

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:59.210
Yes.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:02.380
There used to be a rather unique
court physician here.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.300
Whenever he had free time,
he would wander around the rear palace.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.050
Just like you, he was also curious
about that shrine...

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:11.800
- Wait, could it be Luomen?
- Oh? You know him?

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:14.470
Damn, I let that slip.

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:16.060
He was my foster father.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:19.890
After leaving the rear palace, he ran
an apothecary in the pleasure district.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.400
I see, so you're Luomen's...

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.860
Was this man close to my father?

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:27.780
Maomao!

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.940
Look! I wrote it!

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:31.650
Oh!

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.660
There is no poison.

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.410
- I'll take my leave.
- Wait, Apothecary.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.830
After this, I want you to accompany me.

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:45.420
Where to?

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.630
To the Shrine of Choosing.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.010
Why all of a sudden?

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:54.760
What exactly is he planning to do?

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.510
It's the old shrine I saw during the day.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.600
And also...

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.770
the teacher at the learning hall?

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:03.560
I have been expecting you.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.730
May I pass through it once more?

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:09.900
No matter how many times you come,
it may not change anything,

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.280
but if you are still willing to...

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.160
That’s quite a daring way
to speak to the Emperor.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.870
Who will accompany you?

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.450
Then, these two.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:20.620
What?!

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.410
Isn’t this place off-limits to women?

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.880
The Queen Wang Mu and the Empress Dowager
were both women, you know.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:30.630
- Please, come on in.
- Well then, shall we proceed?

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.260
Three doors?

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.140
"Do not pass through the red door"?

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:43.140
The doors are...

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:45.650
blue, red, and green.

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.520
So we’re supposed to choose
either blue or green?

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.110
Which door will you choose?

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:54.650
I’ll go with blue this time.
Last time, I chose green.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.570
Indeed, that was the case.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:58.450
Well then, this way.

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:05.410
Please consider those of us
who manage this place.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.130
Just when we think it is no longer in use,

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:10.710
someone suddenly shows up.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:12.670
I have caused you trouble.

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.760
Three doors again...

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.600
Green, brown, and light blue.
Next it says,

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:21.970
"Do not pass through the brown door."

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.020
I’ll choose green.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.100
No way...

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:28.560
Will this just keep

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:30.650
repeating forever?

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.320
Going up, going down,
going back, turning around...

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:41.740
I’ve completely lost
my sense of direction.

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.910
It feels like we’re just going
around in circles.

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:48.290
Why did the Emperor bring me here?

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.750
I wish this would end soon.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.470
This is the final door.

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:00.720
The next set of doors are...

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.640
blue, purple, and yellow. And it says,

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:06.600
"Do not pass through the blue door."

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.230
Also, there’s another door leading here.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:13.940
Does that mean there's another path
that merges here?

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:15.360
I’ve decided.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.070
I’ll choose yellow.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:22.200
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:27.120
A dead end?

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.130
"Child of royalty,
yet not child of the Wang Mu."

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:35.050
I don’t understand the meaning,
but it’s clearly a rejection.

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.420
It's the same result as last time.

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:45.010
He looks unusually serious.

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:48.270
Is it impossible for me
to know the will of heaven?

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:50.520
What are you saying?

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.980
Ever since this shrine was sealed
within the rear palace,

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:57.690
I have been the only one
left to manage it.

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:00.280
What meaning could
the will of heaven possibly have?

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.570
This old eunuch was probably

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.410
managing this shrine long before

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:07.160
the rear palace was even established.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:09.290
In order to continue maintaining it,

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:12.000
he went so far as to become a eunuch
just so he could stay here.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.880
Your way out is over there.

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:24.220
The Emperor followed
the instructions on the signs.

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.510
There shouldn’t have been any mistakes.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.930
And yet, he still didn’t
reach the right answer.

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:32.310
Was there another meaning behind all that?

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:34.310
The number of rooms?

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.020
The colors of the doors chosen?

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:39.740
I'm sure Luomen would know.

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.780
My old man would know?

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.160
Are you saying that my father
would be able to figure it out?

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.410
Well, who knows?

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.620
My father's knowledge
is certainly incredible.

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:53.790
But being told, "This is beyond you,"
really pisses me off.

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:58.710
My father's knowledge is exceptional,
especially when it comes to medicine.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.670
Does that mean this is related to that?

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.480
Three doors, three colors...

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:16.770
"Child of royalty,
yet not child of the Wang Mu."

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:20.030
What is the true meaning
behind those words?

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:26.950
Do you understand the meaning of

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:28.580
"Yet not the child of the Wang Mu"?

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:30.450
Now that I think about it...

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.460
In the story of
the founding of the nation,

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:36.330
it’s always the first emperor's mother,
Queen Wang Mu, who appears.

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:37.880
The father is never spoken of.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:41.710
Then one would expect
the maternal lineage to be valued,

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.680
yet in reality,
succession is passed down through males.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.220
If they intended to preserve
Queen Wang Mu's bloodline...

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:51.520
The previous emperor’s older brothers

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.520
all perished due to a widespread illness.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:55.640
Lord Jinshi.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:58.190
Have you realized something?

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:01.650
Were the former emperor’s brothers
full siblings?

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:04.030
Not all of them,

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:07.620
but I heard that the mothers of
the imperial princes were sisters.

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:10.700
In other words,
their blood was quite close.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.540
This may sound rude,

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.370
but may I ask you something?

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.040
I permit it. Speak.

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:22.000
Throughout generations,

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:25.010
haven’t many of the emperors
had poor eyesight?

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:30.720
I have heard that their eyesight
certainly wasn’t very good.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.970
But the previous emperor had good vision.

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:34.680
I knew it.

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:38.350
Is it possible to pass through
that shrine once more?

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:42.070
Does the young lady have
the qualifications for that?

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:45.070
You brought her along with you earlier,

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:47.240
but entering multiple times
is not a good idea.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:51.910
Especially if she intends to interfere
with the choice of doors.

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:55.250
Besides, she’s neither a consort
nor a princess, is she?

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:57.710
I'm just a mere servant girl.

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:01.290
Then shall I elevate her to a consort?

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:04.000
Though convincing Lakan
will be troublesome.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.220
- He must be joking.
- You must be joking!

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:09.090
What would the other consorts think?

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.260
That is true. In that case,

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:15.270
would you take her instead?

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.690
That would be acceptable, wouldn’t it?

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:21.480
If that is His Majesty’s wish.

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:23.820
Then, shall we go?

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.190
He seems more playful than usual.

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:32.580
First, the blue, red, and green doors.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.330
"Do not pass through the red door."

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:37.830
- Which will you choose?
- The blue one.

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:41.750
This is the same
as the one His Majesty chose.

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:46.800
Next, there's green, brown,
and light blue. It says,

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.300
"Do not pass through the brown door."

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:50.590
The light blue door.

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:56.220
The one I chose is different from yours.

00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:00.980
When I passed through earlier,
I didn't realize it.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:02.980
If there is a door that only
a "child of Wang Mu" can choose...

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:08.070
Then the key must lie
in the "color" of the doors.

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:12.950
This is the tenth one.

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:15.490
There's a white, purple, and green door.

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:18.450
It says, "Pass through the red door."

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:23.330
But there is no red door.
What does this mean?

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.340
The green door.

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.340
Green?

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:29.760
You’ll know once you go through.

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.470
This is...?

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.520
Congratulations.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.770
It seems you have chosen the correct path.

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:48.480
Long ago, those chosen by Queen Wang Mu

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:50.820
became the next king.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.820
They would stand here

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:55.820
and swear an oath to the people.

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:59.290
If no one could choose this path,

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:02.620
they would return to this shrine

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:05.380
with a consort who could.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:09.050
Originally, one who inherited
the rightful blood

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:11.050
was meant to do it.

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:12.720
But this time,

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.340
it seems that someone else
has found the answer.

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:18.260
You're the one who provoked me!

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:19.430
What is this guy's problem?

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.180
More importantly, explain this to me

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:25.100
in a way Jinshi can understand.

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:26.150
Perhaps

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:29.070
you should ask the young lady over there.

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:30.990
This guy...

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:33.360
Is he trying to make me explain?

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:34.740
So it seems.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:41.120
In the founding legend,
it is said that Queen Wang Mu

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:45.000
possessed eyes that could
see through darkness.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.250
Those chosen by this shrine...

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:49.630
In other words, those who carry
Queen Wang Mu's blood

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:53.380
are said to have eyes
that cannot distinguish colors.

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:55.340
Eyes that cannot distinguish colors?

00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:57.050
What do you mean?

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.350
Then, allow me to explain the logic

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:02.180
by which I chose the doors earlier.

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:05.690
At first, there were three doors.
Blue, red, and green.

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.690
The instruction was
"Do not pass through the red door."

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:12.480
That means both blue and green
should be correct choices,

00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:13.440
but "the child of Wang Mu"

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:15.860
would have chosen blue.

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:19.370
Because if one cannot distinguish
between red and green,

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:21.950
they would choose the door
that is definitely not red.

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:25.660
Unable to distinguish red from green?

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:27.750
It is rare in this country,

00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:31.340
but in the western lands, it is said that

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.960
one in ten men cannot differentiate
between red and green.

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:36.340
Luomen would know that, wouldn't he?

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:39.390
My father, who studied abroad
in the western lands,

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:41.100
would have known this trait.

00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:43.970
So that's what he meant by that.

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:45.930
The next door followed the same logic.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.270
It said,
"Do not pass through the brown door."

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:51.360
If one cannot distinguish
between brown and green,

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.780
then by process of elimination,
they'd choose the light blue door.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.440
For the final door,

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:57.820
the instruction was
"Pass through the red door."

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:01.080
However, there was no red door.

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:05.790
But if one could clearly distinguish
between white and purple,

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:08.330
then the remaining door must be red.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.040
In other words, while it appeared
as though there were two correct choices,

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:16.300
the correct choice was only one.

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:17.800
But

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.510
if every emperor throughout history
had such a trait,

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:22.600
someone would notice, don't you think?

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.100
My foster father once told me that

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:26.890
even if one cannot distinguish colors,

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.600
they can learn to adapt over time.

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:32.310
So people around them
might not even notice.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.570
And, in exchange for
their difficulty with color perception,

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:37.440
they are said to have
excellent night vision.

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:39.700
That might be the origin of the legend

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:41.660
about the eyes of Queen Wang Mu.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.040
So only those who inherit this trait
from Queen Wang Mu

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.620
can pass through this place?

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:51.290
Perhaps some people have stumbled
through by chance,

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:53.880
but the probability of making it
to the final chamber

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.550
would be incredibly low.

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:58.170
In the old tales,

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.640
it is said that Queen Wang Mu
came from a distant land.

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:06.680
She had the trait of being
unable to distinguish colors,

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:08.140
yet she came from the western lands

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:10.810
with her attendants to this land.

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:13.110
Settling in a new land

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:15.190
wasn't an easy task.

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:17.480
So, she married the leader

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:19.030
of this land.

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:20.820
Wait, Apothecary.

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.870
In the legends, it is said that
Queen Wang Mu had no husband.

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:26.870
That is what makes
Queen Wang Mu so cunning.

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:29.580
To prevent the bloodline
from becoming concentrated,

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:31.500
it was not uncommon

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:33.130
to marry someone from outside.

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:35.250
Although Queen Wang Mu is the ancestor,

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:38.090
the throne has been
passed down by male heirs

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:40.050
because they followed
the method of establishing

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:42.300
the leader of the bloodline.

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:44.930
However, Queen Wang Mu's descendants

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:47.310
couldn't accept the idea
of their blood thinning out

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:49.390
and disappearing entirely.

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:51.940
A way to ensure that Queen Wang Mu's blood

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.400
will be preserved for future generations...

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:56.150
That is the "Shrine of Choosing."

00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:00.070
If no one possesses the trait,

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:03.530
then someone of close blood to
Queen Wang Mu is taken as consort,

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:04.660
and together, they enter the shrine.

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:07.700
The reason why consorts are also allowed

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:09.370
to enter the shrine is because of this.

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:11.250
Bit by bit, in this manner,

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:13.540
they embedded themselves
at the heart of the nation,

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:17.460
erasing the existence of
the original rulers from the stories

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:19.250
until only Queen Wang Mu
remained as the true ancestor.

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:22.420
In time, as those who remembered
the past disappeared,

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:24.930
the only remaining story became the truth.

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:27.850
It was an extremely peaceful yet...

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:29.680
slow shift of power.

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:32.850
Well, of course, that’s not something
I can say right now.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:34.310
So, does that mean

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:36.940
I do not carry the blood of Queen Wang Mu?

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:41.530
The existence of this shrine is
the only definitive way to determine that.

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:43.740
Even if a parent possesses the trait,

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:45.780
it does not always
pass down to their children.

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:50.040
Also, when blood becomes too concentrated,
it can cause adverse effects.

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:53.120
It is possible that
the late emperor’s siblings

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:55.000
fell ill for that very reason.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.250
To think that a mere girl

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:01.460
would actually solve the mystery
is something I never expected.

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.170
"Mere girl"?

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:05.630
It is said that Queen Wang Mu

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.640
was able to rule this land because of

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.850
her exceptional wisdom.

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:12.430
If you're going to dilute
the bloodline at this point,

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:15.390
why not incorporate someone like her?

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:20.190
What nonsense is that old guy saying?

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:22.070
Well, that might be interesting,

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:25.200
but I’d rather not make an enemy
of Lakan, and more importantly,

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.990
she’s lacking about
15 centimeters around the chest.

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:29.740
Mind your own business.

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:32.240
But do be careful.

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:33.830
There are many who would not

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:36.960
welcome the introduction of outside blood.

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:38.460
I am well aware of that.

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:42.090
Does Your Majesty truly understand?

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.840
Please be careful.

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:48.550
Understood.

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:00.980
Who is he really?

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:04.530
Just the Emperor’s favored eunuch?

00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:07.240
Is that really all?

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:11.330
It doesn't matter.

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:13.330
Ignorance is bliss.

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:15.450
That's just how it is.
