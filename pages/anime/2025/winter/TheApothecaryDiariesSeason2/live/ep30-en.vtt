00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.370
Episode 30: The Crystal Pavilion for the Third Time

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.600
Did someone summon me?

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.600
The palace woman from the clinic did?

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.810
Yes, it seems she wants to see you.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.520
I’m sorry. I should have taken

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.690
the medicine you prepared right here.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.150
But the palace woman
from yesterday saw me.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.660
That's a problem.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.910
Only medical officers are allowed
to make medicine, after all.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.330
I deeply apologize.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.540
Will you get in trouble?

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.290
No, it’s just that...

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.540
Tell me what’s going on.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.170
Yes...

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.170
They’re asking to...

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
borrow Maomao for a while.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.800
Maomao?

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.480
Ailan, call Yinghua for me.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.770
Eh? O-Okay.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.490
I got summoned...

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.280
Let’s hurry.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.620
They even sent someone
to keep an eye on me.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.630
My name is Shenlü.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.670
Eyes with a greenish hue...

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.630
Is she, like Lady Gyokuyou,
from the western region?

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.800
Yesterday, she seemed like
a strong-willed mother, but...

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.140
now that we’re talking calmly,
she gives off an intelligent impression.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.810
In any case, being served tea
like this makes me feel awkward.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.690
I was rude to you yesterday. My apologies.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.400
I didn’t realize
you worked under the Consort.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.860
No, it’s fine.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.570
"Consort" refers to Lady Gyokuyou’s title.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.990
Palace women from outside often use
official titles to refer to them.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.870
I summoned you because there’s
something I’d like to ask of you.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.330
Go ahead.

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.370
I want you to make a medicine

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.080
for Wise Consort, Lady Lihua's

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.130
maid at the Crystal Pavilion.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.960
Do you understand what that implies?

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.550
If it gets out that someone other than
a medical officer is making medicine--

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.600
I am fully aware of the consequences.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.010
There seems to be a reason.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.520
Maomao?!

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.350
Please, you can tell me.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.020
Is it alright?

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.820
Could you explain the circumstances?

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.320
Thank you very much.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.820
She's a maid I became acquainted with

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.790
at the laundry area.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.790
Since the caravan season,

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.830
she's been experiencing fatigue
and a slight fever.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.170
Then it escalated into a strange cough.

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:22.970
So I told her to take proper rest.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.680
But after that, she completely
stopped showing up.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.470
Maybe she switched laundry areas,

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.180
or was reassigned?

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.100
Even so,

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.730
that cough needs
to be checked at least once.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.480
So, she hasn't gone to the clinic either?

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.440
Yes.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.360
Perhaps she couldn't get
permission from her superiors.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.450
That's the problem
with the Crystal Pavilion.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.740
If the maid needed permission,

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.080
it wouldn't be from Lady Lihua,
but from the head attendant.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.250
There's a high chance
her request was ignored.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.830
It's already been half a month
since I last saw her.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.670
Half a month!?

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.800
This has turned into
a troublesome situation.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.390
Does such a maid even exist?

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.430
It might be necessary to investigate.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.890
A strange cough, huh?

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.600
If it's contagious,
we can't just leave it be.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.100
It might spread
outside of the Crystal Pavilion.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.570
I know you're the type that worries
about these kind of things, but...

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.450
make sure to ask for permission properly.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.450
Rushing ahead is your bad habit.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.120
Yes.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.700
It won't help to rush.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.080
First, I'll have this issue passed
on to Lord Jinshi.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.040
What I can do right now is...

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.210
Ah?

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:40.130
Wait!

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.340
Maomao!

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.670
Geez, just as I was saying...

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.630
Sorry. I found what I was looking for,
so I couldn't help myself.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.510
- What were you looking for?
- This.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.220
Unfortunately, the main body
managed to escape.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.850
I'm going to make medicine to grow it.
To do that...

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:00.860
I'm trying to figure out

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.230
why its tail grows back.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.150
Lady Yinghua?

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.300
Where are you going?

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:30.970
Lady Shin!

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.930
You’re supposed to be
cleaning the main house.

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.720
Are you going to
show your face there again?

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:37.850
Ah, well...

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.190
I told you, don’t do unnecessary things.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.570
I’m sorry.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.070
I’m really sorry...

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:48.070
Lady Shin!

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.320
The doctor has arrived
from the medical office.

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:52.570
Doctor?

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.200
What does he want?

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.160
He couldn’t even help the Crown Prince.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.540
Do you need something?

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.710
Well... I wanted to see the Wise Consort.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:09.800
I apologize.

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:11.630
Lady Lihua likely

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.550
doesn't wish to meet with you.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.010
Well, but...

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.600
Such a tall woman.
Was there such a palace woman?

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.780
I received a letter like this.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:31.780
JINSHI

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.490
I understand. This way, please.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.620
Excuse me, but Lady Lihua
is in good health.

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:42.670
Ah, that's good to hear.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.380
You must have excellent attendants

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.130
to support the Wise Consort.

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:47.630
Of course we do.

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:50.720
All attendants of the Crystal Pavilion
come from distinguished families.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.470
They are all worthy
of serving the Emperor.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:58.140
Lady Lihua is also of noble birth,
and from the royal family.

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.890
And so am I.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.350
For the sake of the family,

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.400
it is important to gain
the Emperor's favor.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.980
Understood, Lihua and Shin.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:11.900
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:14.410
Then why is it that...

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:21.790
What's the matter?

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:24.460
Well...

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:27.080
I was wondering what that
small building was.

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:32.550
It's nothing, just a storage room.

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:37.300
Have you been tending
to the garden recently?

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:40.600
No, not particularly.

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.560
Now that you mention it, were there always
those bushes in the garden?

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.810
You're wearing perfume today.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:48.770
Huh?

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:50.780
Lady Shin.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.240
Long time no see.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.620
I apologize for
what happened the other day.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.700
Are you the girl from that time?

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.170
Wait a minute!

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:08.170
What are you doing?!

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:15.220
Young lady!

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.150
Boil some water, now!

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:31.900
All right.

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:41.660
Drink this slowly.

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:51.210
Why did you treat her like this?

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.300
There's nothing to explain.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.590
It's to prevent the disease
from spreading.

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:59.140
It's common sense
to isolate the patient, right?

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.800
Indeed,

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:03.890
but while the contagion risk is low,
this is still a transmissible illness.

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:08.640
If such measures continue,
it will lead to her death.

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:11.940
Of course, the death of a single maid

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:14.530
may seem like a trivial matter to you.

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:19.990
I remember when I first came here.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.490
It was when Lady Lihua was
bedridden due to illness.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.250
A fragrance was burned to mask
the smell of the sick person.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.790
What are you trying to say?

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:34.250
This time, I felt it was the opposite.

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.300
The sick person is being placed here

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.880
to mask the smell of the fragrance.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.260
Wait!

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.640
The Crystal Pavilion attendants

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.810
really have many secrets, don't they?

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:55.570
These are the goods from the caravan
that were banned recently.

00:10:56.230 --> 00:11:00.280
Once again, a poor eunuch
will be sentenced to lashes.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.280
Don't get shaken up.

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:08.870
Each small bottle
may not be considered poisonous,

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:10.960
but if you mix them together,
what could happen?

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:14.170
A girl like her could never understand.

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:15.800
What my true purpose is.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.090
Lady Shin.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.840
What are your intentions

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:23.300
in creating an abortion pill?

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:38.780
If I could find her on the first visit,
maybe I didn't need to disguise myself.

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:43.200
My face is known,
so I was prepared for a long battle.

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:48.240
Thank you for waiting.

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:51.580
Thank you for the change of clothes.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.080
Of course.

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.380
You shouldn't walk around
in the clothes you wore

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:57.550
while caring for the sick,
as it could spread the illness.

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:01.090
Shall we go? Everyone is gathered.

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:14.060
What does this mean, Lady Shin?

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.230
The items from the caravan

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:19.570
were to be removed
because they were potentially toxic.

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:21.820
I'm sure that was announced.

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.120
Are you going to keep silent?

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.580
Even when questioned by Lord Jinshi,
she acts like this?

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:31.000
Lady Shin.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.080
She is the head
of the Crystal Pavilion's attendants,

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.330
and also a cousin of Lady Lihua.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.710
Her features are somewhat similar,
attracting attention.

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:40.550
She's an evidently proud
and beautiful woman.

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.840
That is why she became
the head of the attendants.

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:48.970
Beautiful flowers are more noticeable
when gathered in one place.

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:52.810
Given her status, it is not surprising
she moved up to a middle-level consort.

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:55.020
She must be aware of that herself.

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:57.650
Let me change the question.

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:01.150
What were you planning to do
with the prohibited goods?

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:04.070
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:08.530
Indeed, I did instruct that the sick maid
be laid down in the storage room.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.870
But that was to prevent
the spread of the disease.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.790
I didn't know what items were kept there.

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:18.250
Does that make me guilty?

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:23.760
It's not a crime to isolate
the maid in the storage room.

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.260
It can't be helped....that's how little
a maid's life is valued.

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:28.720
Rather than that,

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.600
you came out of nowhere

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:33.220
and demanded to meet Lady Lihua.

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:36.480
Isn't it more of a problem to go snooping
around in other palaces' storage rooms?

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:40.520
After all, the storage room is a place
where no one goes,

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:42.480
except for delivering food to the sick.

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:46.200
To put it another way, anyone could
have approached the storage room.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:49.320
Do you have evidence that
these items belong to me?

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:52.280
You should ask the maid
who was there in that room.

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:54.790
Are you going to trust the words

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:57.370
of a maid who was suffering
from a fever and was delirious?

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.580
How reliable can she be?

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:02.840
So, you knew she was
suffering from a fever?

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.510
How kind of you.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:10.220
To go out of your way to check on
a lowly maid's condition.

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:15.770
Then it's not surprising if the scent
of perfume oil lingers on your body.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:20.520
Before, there was no scent
of perfume oil on you, Lady Shin.

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.020
I shouldn’t go any further...

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:26.940
I understand that, but...

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.530
There are things that make one angry.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.660
Today, Lady Shin,

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:36.620
you smell just like this perfume oil.

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:41.130
This bottle was found inside the chest.

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:44.590
Is it really such a strong scent
that it can be picked up easily?

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:46.510
Just to be sure,

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:49.340
may I check?

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.930
Don't touch me!

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.680
Apothecary!

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:01.310
It's nothing serious.

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:03.230
You're right.

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:06.860
I should have never touched you.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:10.200
Let's have someone else check you.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.490
Could you leave the rest to me?

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:19.910
Lady Lihua.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.790
What crime will she be charged with?

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.460
If she were trying to create
an abortion pill,

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:28.920
it would be the same
as murdering the Emperor's child.

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:32.010
Does that apply
no matter whose consort's child it is?

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:33.340
Of course.

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:39.980
Even if Shin's target was me?

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:43.100
Lady Lihua! That's...

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.190
So that’s what this is about.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:48.280
Lady Lihua's clothes

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.610
are similar to the clothes that
Lady Gyokuyou is wearing.

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:54.660
That explains why there aren’t
any decent attendants.

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.330
It’s not Lady Lihua's fault.

00:15:56.830 --> 00:16:00.290
Those attendants
were gathered intentionally

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.000
by the head attendant, Shin.

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:07.090
Shin, you’ve never treated me
as a consort, have you?

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:09.590
You thought I wasn’t worthy of being

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:12.840
the mother of the nation.

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:15.090
That’s what you must have thought.

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:16.850
You and I,

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.600
we never knew who would become a consort...

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:23.310
until the very end.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.860
Speaking to me as if I'm inferior to you.

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:34.280
I’ve always hated that about you!

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.530
I was better at studying and etiquette!

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.280
And many other things!

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:41.950
I was better than you in so many ways!

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:45.540
Why does everyone around me...!

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:48.880
The size of their chests... No.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.050
The difference in capacity
between them is simply too vast.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:54.970
"Lihua" and "Shin," "Pear" and "Apricot."

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:58.600
Both were born with beautiful names,
having a good background and education.

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:03.480
Still, there are plenty of foolish people
who are ruled by their emotions

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.230
and make mistakes.

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:08.810
Lady Shin is likely one of them.

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:11.150
Because you’re the daughter
of the head of the family?

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:13.190
Does that make you better than me?

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.450
That can't be!

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:15.740
I’ve always been

00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:18.200
raised to become the mother of the nation!

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:21.790
Can I take that as a confession?

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:28.580
May you wither in the flower garden,
unable to bear children!

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:30.750
Lihua!

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.300
Don’t touch me!

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:38.840
How disgusting, a mere eunuch!

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.850
Let go of me! Let go of me!

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:44.180
Lady Shin,

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:46.850
you really do hold the Emperor
in high regard, don’t you?

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.860
- Of course I do! What are you saying?
- No.

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:52.860
I just...

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:58.860
simply thought you seemed to love
the position of the mother of the nation.

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:01.410
Unlike Lady Lihua.

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:19.640
You thought that way, Shin?

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:28.890
Lord Jinshi,

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:32.270
this head attendant has
spoken violent words.

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:34.940
To the point where I had to step in.

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:37.990
Therefore, I will dismiss this person.

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:39.950
Lady Lihua, that is...

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:42.160
Oh, is a slap not enough?

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:45.120
Then, let me do it...

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.290
Please wait!

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:47.580
I won’t!

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:51.880
She's really changed. She's not
the old Lady Lihua anymore.

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:56.510
A woman waiting for
her own life to fade away

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:57.710
is nowhere to be found.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:18:59.760
From now on,

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.390
please forbid her
from entering the rear palace.

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:04.890
What a light punishment...

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:07.850
But for this woman,
it will be enough humiliation.

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:09.480
Even if she bears a grudge,

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:13.400
she can’t do anything, as she was
driven out of the rear palace by scandal.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.860
I'm sure they will never
stand beside each other.

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:23.320
- Use it.
- Huh?

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.450
You're bleeding.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:28.830
It’s fine, it’s just a scar.

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:30.870
Just use it!

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:32.460
Fine.

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:36.710
To stain such fine silk with blood...

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:40.380
How did you know the sick maid
was in the storage room?

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:42.890
Since you were in disguise,

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:45.180
I’m sure you didn’t know
from the start, right?

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:48.390
I had a rough idea.

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:50.180
Since she was ill,

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:53.560
she had to be somewhere out of sight,
away from everyone’s sleeping areas.

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:56.770
I didn’t think it would be
the storage room, though.

00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:59.990
And there was a clue.

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:02.360
Those bushes?

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:03.860
Yes.

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:06.830
Normally those flowers are red.

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:09.410
But only white flowers are blooming.

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:11.460
Someone must have chosen and planted them.

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:16.250
In Feng Shui, the combination of green
and white is said to be good for health.

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:17.590
I see...

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:19.420
And the name...

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.300
'Marvel-of-Peru' is rather ironic.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.010
Marvel-of-Peru?

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:26.510
The white powder in the seeds

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.760
can also be used as an abortion drug.

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:31.600
Those flowers are everywhere!

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:35.440
As long as you don’t misuse them,
it won’t do any harm.

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.110
Just like today’s perfume.

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:41.530
How did Lady Shin know

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:44.660
that perfume could be used
as an abortion drug?

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:48.620
Also, being that it was one of
the trade goods brought in by the caravan.

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:52.830
Even if I interrogate her,
I don’t know if she’ll spill anything.

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:56.580
Apothecary, may I ask you something.

00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:59.590
Within this rear palace,

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:02.880
is there someone who spread the idea that
perfume could be used as an abortion drug?

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:05.550
I don't know.

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:10.060
However, it would be best
to stay cautious.

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:16.270
Um...

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:21.320
Marvel-of-Peru.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.240
What happened to the maid
in the storage room?

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:27.450
She will be leaving the rear palace
and will receive treatment.

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:29.830
That was what Lady Lihua suggested.

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:32.200
She feels responsible for what happened,

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:34.200
so she will bear the cost as well.

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:37.120
I see...

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:51.100
It seems that the apothecary has visited.

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:55.100
Yes. You seem to know everything.

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:57.600
I've been saved by her countless times.

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:05.360
Is something the matter?

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:09.910
No...

00:23:46.030 --> 00:24:00.970
