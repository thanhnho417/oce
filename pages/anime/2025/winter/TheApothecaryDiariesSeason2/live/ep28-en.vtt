THE APOTHECARY DARIES

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.950
‎THIS STORY IS A FICTION AND ALL NAMES OF FIGURES AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS.
MOREOVER, THE STORY HAS NO RELATION TO REAL-LIFE INCIDENTS AND EVENTS.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.480
Hey, look, Maomao.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:52.770
That’s amazing.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.570
Right?

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.610
I see, so you called me to show me this.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.990
It’s an impressive mirror, isn’t it?

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.650
Episode 28: Mirrors

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.120
Do you know what it’s made of?

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.200
This reflection... is it made of glass?

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.120
That’s correct.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.000
Wow, it’s like there are two of you,
Lady Gyokuyou.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.460
Glass mirrors are difficult to make,

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.760
and they can only be imported
from the West.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.510
They’re extremely high-end luxury items.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.010
If you accidentally break it, I wouldn't
even be surprised if you lose your head.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.810
There was a glass hand mirror before too,

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.430
but Yinghua broke it.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.020
Oh, stop bringing that up!

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.610
It’s a good thing that
Lady Gyokuyou is so forgiving.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.360
Maomao, are you interested in this too?

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.410
Yes. How is it constructed?

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.740
If it could be mass-produced domestically,

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.410
we could make a lot of money...

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.750
Yeah, that’s true.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.790
This full-length mirror, you see,

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.460
is a gift from an envoy
from a foreign country.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.920
An envoy, you say?

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.510
Now that you mention it,
that quack doctor did say something...

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.470
The large caravan that arrived was

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.930
supposedly the advance party
sent to welcome a foreign envoy.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.510
It seems they’ve sent gifts
to other high-ranking consorts too.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.520
Don’t say it like that.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.400
Including Consort Gyokuyou,
there are four high-ranking consorts.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.690
Even as an envoy, they can’t show
favoritism to just one person.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.030
Bringing four such
magnificent full-length mirrors,

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.700
whether crossing the desert or the sea,
must have been quite the ordeal.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.160
To go to such lengths
to please the consorts,

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.210
they might be proposing
some major trade deal with this country.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.210
Xiaomao, do you have a moment?

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.800
Lord Gaoshun, what brings you here?

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.380
There’s something I’d like
your opinion on.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.550
Lady Hongniang, may I use
this space for a bit?

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.970
Sure, I don’t mind,

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.720
but is it something private?

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.860
Lady Hongniang also joined us saying that
it was not right for us to be alone,

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.980
but after finding that
Lord Gaoshun has a wife and child,

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.150
she apparently lost all interest.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.490
I’m not sure how helpful I can be,

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:06.620
but what is the talk?

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.450
Actually, a friend of mine
is in a great deal of trouble,

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.120
and it’s quite an unusual story.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.420
There were two daughters
in a certain respectable family.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.210
The two sisters, who were close
in age and looked very similar,

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.720
were raised with love by their parents,

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.930
but by the time they were of age,
their parents became overprotective.

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.680
Not only was one of them restricted,

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.390
but neither of them
was allowed to go outside,

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.390
and they were assigned
a maid to watch them.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.940
The sisters spent their days
confined to the house.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.440
The maid, feeling sorry for them,
occasionally took them out,

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.940
but when their father found out,

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.950
he placed a servant
outside their room to keep watch.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.700
At night, he locked the door,

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.040
so they couldn’t leave.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.250
The originally introverted sisters

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.040
spent their days
doing embroidery in their room,

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:58.840
but one day...

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.880
Father, my sister...

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.010
is carrying the child of an immortal.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.050
That’s...

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.220
An odd story, indeed.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.020
Perhaps the maid secretly
took them out again?

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.690
No, the maid who allowed them to go out

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.900
was dismissed as a warning.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.820
The new maid didn’t have
much interaction with the sisters.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.450
Then... although it’s a shameless story,

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.410
perhaps she had relations with the servant
who was keeping watch?

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.950
That’s also difficult.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.200
The servant wasn’t even allowed to

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:35.960
get close to the room for surveillance.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.880
It is indeed a difficult story, but...

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.090
I don't think there is
anything I can help you with.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.210
If you'd like to know whether it's
possible for a woman to become pregnant

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.930
without having relations with a man,
I can see where you're coming from.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.550
But is such a thing possible?

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.640
It is not the actual conception
of a child,

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.350
but rather the body's illusion
of pregnancy.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.190
At a brothel, a young courtesan

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.310
once told me that she was pregnant

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.360
with the child of the man she loved.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.190
She wasn’t actually pregnant?

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.280
That’s correct.
Even so, her period stopped,

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.320
and her chest and abdomen swelled.

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.330
The effects of belief
on the body can be significant.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.580
Are you certain that
the younger sister became pregnant?

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.040
Well... yes... probably...

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.790
Let’s leave it at that.

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.300
The issue is...

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.840
whether the younger sister managed to
slip away unnoticed by the surveillance.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.300
So, do you know how the sisters
were being watched?

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.020
Yes, I have a floor plan here.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.940
The sisters lived in

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.770
a detached building on the north side,
which was connected

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.320
to the main house by a western corridor.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.900
Where was the restroom?

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.780
It was inside the detached building.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.610
If the younger sister were to escape...

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.950
The only exit would be
the western corridor.

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.950
There are windows
on the east and south sides,

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.910
but the servants were keeping watch.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.540
Where were the servants stationed
to watch?

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.800
The south-facing windows
were being watched from the third floor,

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.800
and the east-facing windows
were monitored from the first floor.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.180
The visible range is quite limited,
isn't it?

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.810
- The interior wouldn't be visible at all.
- Yes.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.310
However, it seems the sisters

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.310
often sat by the windows to do embroidery.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.270
That’s quite an unusual hobby...
embroidery, of all things.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.030
It seems they were originally
a nomadic family.

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:31.150
I wonder...

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.030
It feels like the key details
are being left vague somehow.

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.950
The east and south windows
seem to belong to the same room.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.040
The bedrooms were arranged separately
for the sisters.

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:46.630
Was this detached building
originally meant for guests?

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.420
You’re quite observant, aren’t you?

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.470
- How many servants were watching it?
- Two.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.180
Each of them had the same
assigned position throughout.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.010
He seems to know an awful lot of details.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.600
Yet, he's not sharing everything.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.230
This feeling...

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:05.350
Is this really a story about a "friend"?

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.360
Should I say something or just keep quiet?

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:12.490
I almost forgot, Xiaomao,

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:15.160
I have something from Lord Jinshi.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.910
It is an apology for the delay
in the delivery of the ox bezoar.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.120
Ox bezoar! Now that you mention it,
I haven’t received it yet.

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:26.630
I kept quiet to avoid getting headbutted
again, but the delivery is late!

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:30.670
My apologies, but it seems the
demand has suddenly increased.

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:33.090
Why all of a sudden?

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.760
Recently, I’ve heard that...

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:41.020
many people have been sending
rare elixirs to Lord Jinshi.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.560
It’s rumored that he’s been
eagerly searching for them.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.940
Well, that’s the gist of it.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:48.560
Anyway, here you go.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.330
What is that?

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.710
- It's bear bile.
- It’s the dried gallbladder of a bear.

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:09.920
Although it has a bitter taste, it is a
valuable herb used in digestive ailments!

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.300
I’m glad you’re pleased with it.

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:15.380
Originally, Lord Jinshi
wanted to hand it to you personally.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:21.640
So, did you notice anything
from what I mentioned?

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.980
Understood.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.270
Could you please wait for a moment?

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.570
Assuming these nuts represent the sisters,

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.490
does this match where they usually sat?

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:40.580
Yes, that’s correct.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.450
There were two servants watching.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.660
Each of them always kept watch
from the same position.

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:46.580
So...

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:50.080
What if we place a mirror like this?

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:53.670
It's as if there's another nut.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:55.590
Similarly,

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:59.640
what if there was a large mirror
near this eastern window?

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:02.600
From the watch position,
it would be too far away and

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.970
hard to notice,
even if it seemed a little unnatural.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.060
In other words,
only one person was actually in the room,

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:11.150
and the other was simply
a reflection in the mirror?

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:14.480
If the sisters look very similar,

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:17.450
it might have been difficult
for the servants to tell them apart.

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:20.740
But, Maomao, what about the embroidery?

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.040
Weren’t the two working
on different pieces of embroidery?

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.450
Yes, I’ve heard
they were embroidering animals.

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.830
I think it was a bird and a rabbit.

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:30.580
For example...

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:33.290
what if the picture looked
something like this?

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:38.050
If you flip this picture upside down,

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:40.680
doesn’t the smiling face
look like an angry face?

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.970
So, you’re saying the embroidery
was also an optical illusion?

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.430
If it were reflected in a mirror
and reversed left to right,

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:52.980
the pattern might have looked like
something entirely different.

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:56.610
While one of them was
embroidering by the southern window,

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:59.530
the other could have slipped out
through the western entrance.

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:00.990
I think that's possible.

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:02.570
I see...

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.580
Certainly, with that method,

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:07.660
it would be possible to sneak out
for a secret meeting.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:10.500
The mirror brought by the foreign envoy...

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.830
since it reflects so beautifully,

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:16.420
it would be easy to mistake something
when seen from a distance.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:20.010
Long ago, my father studied abroad
in a western country

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:23.890
and he said that embroidery was
a high-class privilege for children.

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:25.720
Lord Gaoshun said

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:27.680
that a young woman from a good family

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:29.640
snuck out of the house
and became pregnant.

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:33.020
I'm skeptical about
how much of that is true.

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:35.270
What he is actually hiding...

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.650
might be a completely different secret.

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.450
There are times when someone
suspected of being a spy

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:43.160
is welcomed as a guest.

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:47.620
However, I don’t dig too deeply
into matters like that.

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.950
Rather...

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:55.290
I’m more curious about what
I could make with this bear bile.

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:03.720
The most beautiful woman
who sheds tears of pearl?

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:07.890
The high-ranking officials in charge of
reception begged me to bring her.

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:11.640
Lord Jinshi, you don’t have to go out
of your way to add extra work.

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:13.980
I know!

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:18.110
What were those envoys thinking,

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:20.940
bringing those mirrors and all?

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:25.660
Apothecary. Have you heard the story of

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:28.080
a beautiful woman
shedding tears of pearls?

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:32.080
What is it?

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.290
If it's a beautiful woman,
she’s right in front of you.

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:36.290
I wish I could say that.

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:40.420
What does "tears of pearls" mean?

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.010
I don’t know the details, but...

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:47.010
She was a beauty like the moon spirit,

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:48.010
and when she danced,

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.600
light would swirl as if to bless her,

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:54.440
and her tears turned into pearls,
which then fell.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.650
Apparently, she was a courtesan
from the pleasure district.

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:02.110
A moon spirit?
Why the sudden mention of that?

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:04.650
It’s the wish of the envoy
who is here now.

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:07.570
Envoy, you mean from the West?

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:11.660
When the envoy was young,

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:14.500
they often heard stories from
their grandfather about the moon spirit.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:19.590
So, they asked me to find her
because they want to meet her.

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:23.380
Their grandfather, huh?
That must have been a long time ago.

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:26.380
It’s an impossible request, but

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:28.340
they’re an important diplomatic figure.

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:29.890
I want to do everything I can.

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.970
Have you heard any rumors about it?

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.940
Fifty years ago...

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.940
A dancer from the pleasure district...

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.730
The moon spirit...

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:43.530
Of course,
this is a story from decades ago,

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:45.780
so I don’t even know if she’s still alive.

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:47.110
She’s alive.

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:49.200
Is that true!

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.620
True or not,

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.990
you’ve met her, Lord Jinshi.
In the pleasure district.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:56.160
- Me?
- Yes.

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:59.880
I don’t recall meeting anyone
who fits that description.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.960
It’s understandable
that you can't remember her right away.

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:06.300
- Could it be...?
- That's right.

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:10.300
It’s the Granny. From the Rokushoukan.

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:14.390
Well, who is she?

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:20.190
I believe she’ll come immediately
if money is offered.

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:23.320
- What will you do?
- No, no, I don't think...

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:26.940
But the other party knows
that she’s a person

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:28.950
from 50 years ago, right?

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:31.030
Isn’t a replacement beauty fine then?

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.910
About that...

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:35.950
I already arranged
a banquet with beauties.

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:38.750
They may not be as beautiful
as the moon spirit,

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:41.290
but I gathered quite a selection.

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.470
Yet the other party didn’t seem satisfied,

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:50.630
and in fact, they laughed derisively.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.010
What kind of people are they?

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.350
Excuse me, but those beauties...

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:58.180
- Did they accompany them at night--
- Maomao!

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:00.600
That approach didn't work.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.110
The envoy is a woman, after all.

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.610
Oh, so that’s how the conversation
ended up with Lord Jinshi.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.320
He possesses a beauty
that would captivate anyone,

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.280
and his gender is technically male.

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:15.200
He is more than capable
of making women fall for him,

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:16.870
a truly exceptional talent.

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:19.330
However, trouble may also arise.

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:23.420
If his charm is taken seriously
and they ask for a night together,

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:24.840
there’s nothing he can do.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.500
Of course, despite being a woman

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:29.510
with her position as envoy,

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:32.340
she likely wouldn’t engage
in such a foolish act,

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:34.350
but it's better to avoid it all together.

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:39.270
How important
is this "envoy," I wonder?

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:42.560
She controls the trading posts
in the West and North.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:43.730
Does that give you an idea?

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:46.770
The reason this caravan is so large,

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:49.860
is that both sides want to
advance discussions on new trade.

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:51.950
I see.

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:55.070
I’ve heard that in distant countries,
inter-country marriages are common,

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.160
and there are beautiful men
and women everywhere.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.670
For someone from such a country
to call that Granny a "moon spirit."

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:06.590
Do you think they mixed some kind of
hallucinogen into the incense?

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:08.550
Would they really do such a thing?

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:10.760
I don't think so, but it's probably
the easiest way.

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:13.880
If you did that,
it would become a diplomatic issue.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:16.930
At this point, anything will do.

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:18.890
Do you have any information
from back then?

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.480
He must be really troubled.

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.400
Well, if he's that desperate...

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.360
I’m sorry to have you
come all the way here.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.860
This is quite an odd story you’ve brought.

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:36.780
This place is pretty grim, huh?

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:38.910
Don’t you offer a cup of tea or something?

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:41.870
Well, this is a meeting room.

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:44.330
Old woman,

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:47.080
you hosted an envoy from
a foreign country long ago, didn’t you?

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:49.170
Ah, yes, I did.

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:51.550
It was over 50 years ago, I think.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:53.970
It was during the reign
of the previous, previous ruler.

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:57.970
Originally, there was a town
built using ruins,

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:00.970
and many people came for sightseeing.

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:03.640
Because it was a place
with a lot of people coming and going,

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:05.560
there was apparently a bit of a conflict

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:08.150
when it was suddenly decided
to make it the capital.

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:11.440
The capital had just moved
and there was no great castle,

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:13.990
so there was no place to host visitors.

00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:16.320
The ruler was quite troubled,

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:19.870
and in the end, it was decided to use
the remaining ruins to host them.

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:21.660
It used to be
some kind of ceremonial hall.

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:25.500
And near the fruit orchard,
there was a beautiful pond and buildings.

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:27.250
Is that...?

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.460
On the north side of the rear palace
which I visited recently,

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.420
there was a ruined fruit orchard.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.550
It wouldn't be surprising if the venue

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:37.430
for the banquet at that time
was now inside the rear palace.

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:40.720
As the lead dancer on that stage,

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.600
I was chosen from the pleasure district.

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:45.520
Why were you chosen?

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.350
Well, that's because...

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.980
I was the highest-ranked courtesan
at the time.

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:52.610
I danced with a dozen
or so others as the main star.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.490
Now, you look more like a withered branch

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:57.240
than a flower.

00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.570
But well, the main reason
was probably my physique.

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:01.620
Huh?

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:04.080
I was tall...

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.120
and had a well-defined body.

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:09.420
Certainly, if you're going to stand
on stage as the lead,

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.630
a larger body would be better.

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:12.960
But you know,

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:14.800
since it was an improvised setting,

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.920
I struggled with the preparations.

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:20.140
I even calculated the phases of the moon,

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.600
and to improve the view from the banquet,

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.430
I removed any obstacles.

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:28.190
Since the orchard was nearby,
there were lots of insects,

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:30.150
so I had to remove
every single caterpillar

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:32.820
from the leaves beforehand.

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:33.900
In the end,

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:36.990
the insects still gathered around
due to the torches.

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:39.660
Even though I prepared all that,

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:43.280
on the day of the event, there were people
who played pranks on my outfit.

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.660
They rubbed insect corpses onto it.

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:50.170
But I was not weak.

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:53.090
I hid it with fabric
and managed to pull it off.

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:55.170
The result was a great success!

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:57.670
The person who played the prank
was regretful.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:01.430
I've heard that story many times.
Isn't there something else?

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:04.010
You're not a cute one, huh!

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:04.970
Ouch...

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:14.690
It's a beautiful painting.
It's the first time I've seen it.

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:16.980
The old woman must have cherished it.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.160
For this fantastical beauty

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.530
to become a slave to gold.

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:27.830
It seems that the envoy

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:31.420
went all the way back to his home country
to have it painted by a painter.

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.500
He named this painting "Moon Goddess."

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:37.300
I see. So this painting
has been beautified as well.

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:38.960
Did you say something?

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:40.760
Nothing.

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:44.800
That envoy never set foot
on this land again,

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.600
but he entrusted
the caravan to deliver it.

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:51.520
But, old woman,

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.600
you just did your usual work, right?

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:55.270
Why were you so well-liked?

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.530
I don't know that either.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:05.030
The old woman is someone
who can view things objectively.

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.530
There’s no exaggeration in her words.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.120
However...

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:11.460
No matter how beautiful
the old woman was back then,

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:16.460
why did they call her a Goddess?

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:21.050
I don’t understand.

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:24.840
Well then, shall we search for someone
who resembles the woman in this painting?

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:27.180
That’s all I can think of...

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.310
Honestly, it’ll be hard
to find a tall beauty

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:32.810
who resembles this painting.

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:34.940
Why don’t we try finding a tall woman,

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:37.520
even if her face doesn’t resemble hers?

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:40.530
Although she’s quite shrunk now,

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:43.780
back then she was said to be 175 cm tall.

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:45.450
She was quite tall.

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:48.410
Yes. Since she was good at dancing,

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:51.410
having long arms and legs
made her look even more impressive.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:52.700
However,

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:55.830
when it comes to finding
a tall beauty to match her,

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.250
that is quite a challenge.

00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:00.300
The envoys are about that height as well,

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:03.800
so if the beauty is too small,
she might look like a child.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.930
Envoys?

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:08.600
It's not just one?

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:12.310
Yes, they’re said to be cousins
who share the same grandfather.

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:36.420
