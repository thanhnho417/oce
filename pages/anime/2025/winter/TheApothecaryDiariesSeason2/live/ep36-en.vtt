THE APOTHECARY DARIES

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.410
‎THIS STORY IS A FICTION AND ALL NAMES OF FIGURES AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS.
MOREOVER, THE STORY HAS NO RELATION TO REAL-LIFE INCIDENTS AND EVENTS.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.520
A few high-ranking officials
who grasped the situation

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.890
have already gone out to search, but…

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.690
Where in the world could he have gone?

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.690
Maybe he disappeared
with his female attendant.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.230
A secret date?

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.110
No way. That’s ridiculous.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.110
However…

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.490
It’s been two hours
since he left his seat.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.750
I’ve sent subordinates to search for him,
but there’s been no progress.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.830
Right now, I can’t
rely on my father either.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.380
Earlier, he seemed to have given

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.590
some sort of order to that maid.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.340
But still, no matter what the master said,
I should have gone with him.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.850
I’m sick of playing a meaningless role.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.100
If only the host

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.270
would bring this gathering to an end.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.060
Shishou.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.150
As always,

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.980
he’s a man whose thoughts
are impossible to read.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.570
That said, he wouldn't want any trouble

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.070
at a banquet he's hosting.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.240
Which means…

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.530
This matter likely has
nothing to do with Shishou.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.100
Episode 36: Ka Zuigetsu

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.470
It’s warm.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.390
And there's a faint scent
of incense as well.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.810
But more importantly, this is…?

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:04.810
What is this?

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.440
Is it that frog from earlier?

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.400
It’s too big for that, though.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.860
Sorry, but…

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.320
could you move your hand away from there?

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.990
There’s a situation down there.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.200
A situation?

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.000
It can’t be.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.500
A eunuch who enters the rear palace…

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.130
should not have this.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.130
But he does.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.970
Thinking back,
he never acted like a eunuch.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.010
There are plenty of things
that come to mind,

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.480
but maybe I unconsciously
avoided thinking about them.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.230
He has the face of a celestial maiden,

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.900
but Lord Jinshi is…

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.240
In a way, this saves me
the trouble of having to explain.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.200
I want to tell you something.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.040
No, I must not hear any more.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.290
That is why I brought you along this time.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.460
Once I hear this,
I’ll have to take it to the grave.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.130
Apothecary, I--

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.170
My apologies!

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.090
I might have crushed a frog.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.430
Huh? A frog?

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.010
It suddenly fell from above,

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.230
and I lost my balance.

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.980
Are you injured?

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.810
-No, that was not a frog--
-It was a frog!

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.980
A frog. That was a frog.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.780
Come on,
let’s hurry up and get out of here.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.870
A frog, you say?

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.790
If it wasn’t a frog, then what was it?

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.000
Frogs are usually smaller, aren’t they?

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.000
In this season,
there are plenty of fairly large frogs.

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.460
Fairly…?

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.170
Yes, fairly!

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.090
If it wasn’t a fairly large frog, then
what was it that was fairly large, huh?

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.390
Hey! What are you wiping your hands for?

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.140
Well, frogs are gross, right?

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.890
They secrete mucus and all.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.140
Gross…?

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:11.520
What about mucus!

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.020
Anyway,

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.820
I know nothing.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.360
Knowing too much is never a good thing.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.360
Lord Jinshi is a high-ranking official,
and I am merely a servant.

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.620
Nothing more, nothing less.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.580
There's no need to know
unnecessary secrets.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.920
Do you want to check?

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.510
I definitely went too far
with the provocation!

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.770
What should I do? Should I kick him?

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:13.620
What was that?

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.050
Well done.

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.470
Hey! What’s wrong, boy?

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.350
Suddenly running off like that.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:30.310
This voice…

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:34.230
Lord Lihaku!

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.900
Could you please pull us up?

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.520
Huh? Young lady!

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.780
What are you doing in a place like that?

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:44.740
I see.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.120
So, you were targeted by a gun
and had to jump into the waterfall.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.290
They fired,
but I couldn’t see their faces.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.500
I’m glad you’re safe.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.460
So, why are you with this guy?

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.840
It’s hard to explain.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.050
Ah, well, whatever.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.930
Can you tell me

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.260
which men brought a gun for this hunt?

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.060
No one. Such a thing is unsuitable
for hunting in the forest.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:16.020
It’s more reasonable to assume someone
secretly brought it for an assassination.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:18.190
Shall we inspect their belongings then?

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:19.770
But…

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.980
The guests are all high-ranking officials
invited by Lord Shishou.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.610
I doubt any of them would keep
an assassination weapon on hand.

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:31.530
Lord Lihaku, that dog,

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.000
besides responding to the whistle,
is it trained for anything else?

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:40.500
It's able to find rabbit holes, at least.

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:42.920
It’s got a charming personality, but…

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.880
Ji-- I mean, Lord Kousen.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.380
What?

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:48.550
He’s angry.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:50.430
Well, of course.

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:54.020
After what happened,
I couldn’t help but provoke him.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.520
But he was trying to tell me
something important.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.150
And yet, because I didn’t want to know,

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:01.270
I kept on saying ridiculous things.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:05.530
He is someone with great confidence
in his appearance.

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:08.490
Even his "frog" must be quite dignified.

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:10.200
And yet, I called it "fairly."

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:13.280
It’s awkward,

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:15.370
but I have to say what needs to be said.

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:17.620
Perhaps,

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:21.540
we can identify the shooter from earlier.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:29.550
Excuse me.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.550
What is it?

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:32.680
This.

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:39.520
Hey, is that…

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:43.020
It’s my master's robe.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.490
I found it caught on the river rocks.

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:52.070
There was no one nearby. Also,
beyond that point, the current is strong.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.240
With last night’s rain,
the water level has risen.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:56.950
If he was swept away…

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.080
Search for him immediately!

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.250
-Yes!
-Hurry!

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.460
Panicking now won’t change anything.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:08.760
Then, I’ll join the search as well.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.850
What are you planning, Lord Jinshi?

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.610
What the heck!

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:35.370
Ah, my apologies!

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.330
What a poorly trained dog.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.120
Damn!

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.460
There, there.

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:53.380
What’s wrong?

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:54.430
Lord Basen!

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:55.340
This…

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:01.560
This is my master's robe. Is this blood?

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.020
Was anyone around?

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:05.440
The ground isn’t wet,

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.480
so I don’t believe anyone was nearby.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:09.440
I see.

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:12.530
However,
this was found along with the robe.

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:14.530
A hawk feather?

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:17.700
Was it made as a talisman for falconry?

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:20.120
Possibly.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.000
I’m sorry, but…

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.670
could I ask to check
everyone’s belongings?

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:28.920
We found it!

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.630
It’s the same arrowhead
as the one found at the riverbank.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.760
I don’t know anything!
This must be a mistake!

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.390
Then why was your arrowhead

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:42.310
found by the river
along with our master's robe?

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:43.230
Loen?

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:44.850
S… Someone…

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.020
Someone must have
switched it with my arrowhead!

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.770
To frame me!

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.730
What does he mean? Could it be…?

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.990
Loen’s reaction seems genuine.

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:57.990
And his men don’t seem suspicious either.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:01.790
Then, why not check if there are

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:03.620
any other arrowheads?

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:05.290
Not just the riverbank,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.170
but a thorough search
of the forest as well.

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:11.710
Understood.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.300
Conduct a thorough search of the forest!

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:15.340
Yes, sir!

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:27.060
Let’s hope they take the bait.

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:35.950
Damn it! What the hell is going on!

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:37.860
I don’t know anything about an arrowhead!

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.450
Did you find something?

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:46.460
Is that…?

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:52.630
Give it back!

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.220
You… You’re the guy from earlier!

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.770
It seems dogs don’t like you very much.

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:21.200
With this scent, any dog
with a keen nose would react immediately.

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:25.910
So that’s why you didn’t bring

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:27.960
the dog along on your hunt.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.750
The contents have
already been confiscated.

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:34.090
There were three guns inside.

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:36.550
It's foreign-made.

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:39.180
Most likely
the latest model from the West.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.470
I can still smell the gunpowder.

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:44.930
They’re quite small.

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:47.220
I’ve never seen this type before either.

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:54.820
I see, it sparks using a metal component.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:59.530
When gunpowder - made from charcoal,
saltpeter, and sulfur - explodes,

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:03.620
it gives off a stench so strong
that you'd want to pinch your nose.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.040
A smell like a rotten eggs.

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:08.580
Yes,

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:11.460
it’s the same smell I smelled
when we were shot on the cliff.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.420
When we let the dog sniff the gunpowder,

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.630
it immediately tracked down this gun.

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:22.380
And of course, it also picked up the scent
of gunpowder on the shooter as well.

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:23.890
What a smart dog.

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:27.520
Good boy.

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.100
Even though it was a setup,

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.020
I feel bad for the old guys
who were used as bait.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.360
Lord Kousen!

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:37.980
Basen.

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:39.990
What was that gunshot just now?
Are you hurt?

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:43.030
One moment you disappear,

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:44.910
and then, I'm shown a torn piece of cloth,

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:47.120
and then I'm told, "Take me to this man."

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.250
I have no idea what is going on!

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.830
Sorry. What’s the situation?

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:57.460
The people related to this man

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:00.550
are being watched so
they can be captured at any time.

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:04.130
So, all that’s left is
to confirm the charges.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.180
Understood.

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:23.740
After that, the masked guest
returned to the mountain lodge,

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.620
and the banquet ended.

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:38.040
The midday disappearance incident

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:42.970
was officially handled as a whim
of the masked person.

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:44.930
It’s a well-known fact that

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.930
at the banquet,
a certain group disappeared.

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:51.600
From now on, those people

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.770
will never appear
on the public stage again.

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:59.020
He looked tired,
as if something had happened.

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.240
But as someone standing here
in place of Lord Jinshi,

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.320
it is not my place
to be concerned about that.

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:12.040
I still have a long way to go.

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:16.080
Was it too dull a spectacle for a eunuch?

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:19.340
No, I have been enjoying myself.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.460
It must be difficult,

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:26.380
having just drawn the Empress's wrath
and then being forced to become a eunuch.

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:28.220
That’s all in the past now.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.810
Besides, the sake for moon viewing
is quite fine.

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:35.770
I became a eunuch, cast away my name,

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:38.060
and took on the name Gaoshun.

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:40.810
Yet, during the banquet,

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.530
I was still treated as
a member of the Maa household.

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:46.280
That’s how things are.

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:50.320
Still, it’s a pity that
the beautiful eunuch

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:53.790
did not participate in this hunt.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:57.710
Well, we have the masked one
in attendance this time.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:01.380
If such a beautiful face were to join,

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:05.090
it would overshadow everything else.

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:07.420
They say the masked one

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:11.600
bears severe burn scars
upon his noble face.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:15.220
I hear that even tonight,
he remains locked away in his room.

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:17.350
The Emperor must be worried.

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:20.060
To think that "he" is the Crown Prince.

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:21.860
Yes…

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:23.570
"He," huh?

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:26.490
There is no sign of reverence
toward the Crown Prince.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.530
So, what of it?

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:32.830
Since the death of the previous Prince,

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:34.990
has any consort conceived a child?

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.910
I’m afraid I don’t know.

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:42.000
Apologies, I may have had
a bit too much to drink.

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:49.260
Everyone is watching, trying to determine

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:52.300
whether the guest of honor for this hunt…

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:55.350
that is, His Majesty’s younger brother

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:59.770
is truly fit to inherit the throne.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.980
I wonder…

00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:08.110
Has Lord Jinshi told Xiaomao the truth?

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:13.070
She must be informed

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.530
in order to prepare
for the challenges ahead.

00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:16.830
She is, after all,

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:18.910
a highly valuable asset.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.120
It may sound cruel,

00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:25.790
but the more usable pieces
we have, the better.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.630
Yet again, this affair
has left an unpleasant aftertaste.

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:35.140
Just like back then…

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:38.970
There’s still a lot we don’t know about

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:41.230
the source of the gun
and their true intentions.

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:43.810
It's foreign-made.

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.230
Most likely
the latest model from the West.

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:48.530
The West, huh?

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:52.860
Identical envoys, like two mirror images.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:57.490
The story that one daughter managed to
slip out of her room while being watched.

00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:00.040
Most likely,
that story is about the twin envoys.

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:02.410
What exactly was she doing

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.580
sneaking out of her room?

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:08.460
Was she plotting some treachery,

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:10.880
like the younger sister
who became pregnant?

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.220
Or perhaps…

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:18.390
I can only hope the men we captured today
can give us some answers.

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.810
Got a moment?

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.350
Why is he here?!

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.940
Wasn't he at the banquet?

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:33.860
No need to open the door.

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:36.700
I must have startled you quite a bit.

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:37.910
Sorry about that.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.540
I don’t even have to see your face

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.330
to know what expression you’re making.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.540
I don’t mind.

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.590
If anything,
I should be the one apologizing.

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:53.880
For saying it was "fairly" large.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.640
I wonder what Lord Jinshi is thinking?

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:01.180
I’ve never been good

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:03.520
at reading people’s emotions.

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:08.690
The women who raised me were courtesans,
devoted to their work above all else.

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:13.110
No matter how much I cried,
I was ignored until their work was done.

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:17.110
In time, I came to understand,

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:19.870
and eventually,
I became a baby who didn’t cry.

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:22.740
Maybe that’s why

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:25.620
I struggle to recognize
both kindness and malice in people.

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:28.170
Even now,

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:30.460
I don’t know what I’m supposed
to say in times like these.

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:34.050
I won't say anything.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.260
To me,

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:42.260
Lord Jinshi is Lord Jinshi.

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:47.850
That’s how I truly feel.

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:51.230
Whether you have balls or not,

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.610
it’s not like
I’d be looking at them anyway.

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:55.650
So it doesn’t matter to me.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.410
To you, am I still me?

00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:06.160
No need to be so wary.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.540
I just wanted to give you this.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.680
Along with giving you that,

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.600
there’s something I’ve been
meaning to tell you.

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:25.640
It might cause you some trouble, but…

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:26.810
This is…

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.730
The reason I brought you
on this journey was…

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:31.270
O…o…o…

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.860
That is why!

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:35.070
Ox bezoar!

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:37.320
A highly valuable ox bezoar!

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.740
The legendary elixir
I’ve dreamed of is now

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:41.740
in my hands!

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:44.870
Ah. Sorry for keeping you waiting.

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:46.330
I finally got to--

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:48.290
No, that’s not it!

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:49.920
Thank you very much!

00:20:58.800 --> 00:20:59.760
Well then, good night!

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:05.970
Hey! Don’t just slip away on your own!

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:08.140
I’m not finished talking yet!

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:13.980
I don’t want anyone to interfere!

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:15.320
I'm so happy!

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:22.200
Whether Lord Jinshi is a eunuch
or not doesn’t matter to me.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.950
But I do owe him for the ox bezoar.

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:29.160
If his secret is ever exposed
and he finds himself in danger,

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:30.460
at that time…

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.710
I’ll make sure to turn
him into a real eunuch.

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:39.260
Hey, are you even listening!

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:42.590
Hey! Listen until the end
when someone’s talking!

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:44.850
In this country,

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:47.010
some bear the character
"Flower" in their name.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:49.350
-There are currently only two of them.
-Apothecary!

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:54.270
The Emperor, who stands
at the pinnacle of the nation.

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:55.440
And…

00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:57.900
Lord Jinshi…

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.820
No, the Moon Prince.

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:05.780
You cannot remain
in a temporary position forever.

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:11.200
You are the Emperor’s younger brother,

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:14.960
Ka Zuigetsu.
