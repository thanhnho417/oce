THE APOTHECARY DARIES

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.010
‎This story is a work of fiction. The names of all of the characters, organizations, and so on
are imaginary. It also bears no connection to any specific real-life events.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.930
I never intended to let you meet Mother.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.890
I had to pretend
you were "a new apothecary."

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.400
Father says she was not like this
in the past, but,

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.900
who knows.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.950
To me, she has always been
that kind of woman, ever since I was born.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.120
She bullied my sister,
mistreated young maids,

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.450
corrupted our female relatives.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.620
Father never says a word.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.160
No, he cannot. He cannot go against her.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.750
He just keeps waiting for her forgiveness.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.670
Once she has a child,
she devours the husband.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.340
Like an insect.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.890
No, insects are better,

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.770
they do it to ensure
their offspring survive.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.100
I do not want to become like her.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.060
Shisui had even taken
abortifacients herself.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.110
She refused to become a mother.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.440
To her, there is only one "mother."

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.610
But she never wanted to
become like Shenmei.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.370
That must be the real reason.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.830
I looked into you a little, Maomao.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.710
Your father is a senior official, and you
were raised by a former court physician.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.920
You remind me of Sister.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.420
I do not have a father or a mother.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.010
Only an old man.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.140
Sister used to say
something like that too.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.800
Yes. I suppose so.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.020
She probably was never my sister at all.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.640
Father is a tanuki.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.810
Maybe he was plotting something by keeping
Sister, who carries imperial blood,

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.400
close to him.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:14.780
So,

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.740
Sister has nothing to do with
the Shi clan.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.580
Liar.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.040
The way she looked just now,
they really are alike.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.040
Shisui adores her sister Suirei.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.380
That's why, even in this situation,
she's defending her as irrelevant.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.880
But that logic will not hold.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.430
Suirei has been far too involved
in all these incidents.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.230
Hey, Maomao.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.520
If these children were insects,

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.400
they might have survived the winter.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.360
If they were insects?

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.450
Insects cannot survive winter.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.570
They just leave behind their young.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.830
So that is it.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.750
That is why she brought me here.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.670
Shisui.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.670
Shisui is

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.170
not coming back.

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.170
Shisui.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.350
She should have run.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.930
Thrown it all away

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.730
and escaped with Suirei.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.100
Throw away politics, parents, the clan,

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.900
everything.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.940
Even I do not care about other people

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.950
I only care about myself.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.370
Do you have any idea what I have
been through since being brought here?

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:46.870
And yet.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.170
Why?

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.550
Why can I never stop myself
from reaching out?

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.140
Do not stop me.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.760
I have

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.060
a duty of my own.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.520
Does it even mean anything?

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.480
It is pride. My pride.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.230
Then throw it away.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.820
Hey, Maomao.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.450
If you had a chance
to drink an unknown poison,

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:29.080
just once, what would you do?

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.910
I would drink it.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:32.540
Thought so.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.800
She is leaving.

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.800
But I do not know what to say

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.220
to stop her!

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:47.810
Shisui!

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.890
At least let me make a wish.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.400
A wish?

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.440
That is not like you.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.650
Just this once, okay? Just once.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.280
I want it back someday. It's a gift.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.280
Do not ask the impossible.
I might just sell it off.

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.790
That is fine by me.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.880
The collar, not the hair?

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.800
If you put anything more in your hair,
it will be too flashy.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.140
Your face and hair are
already covered in soot.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.930
You are right, I look like a tanuki.

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:34.810
Thank you, Maomao.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:45.660
I leave the rest to you.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.040
"I leave the rest to you," huh.

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:08.300
Let us go back a little in time.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.500
Episode 46: Royal Guard

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.060
Time is of the essence!

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.810
Had our departure been delayed any longer,

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.190
I might have dragged you here by force!

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.440
Father, if one were to raise a hand

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.520
against royalty,

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:25.530
would only that person
be held accountable?

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:30.120
- Lahan.
- Yes?

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:35.460
Did you realize it?
That Jinshi and I are the same person.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.710
Yes. Height, weight, chest, waist.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:44.300
It is rare for all those numbers
to match exactly.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.890
Such beauty.
It is a pity you are not a woman.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.260
Now then, let us go over the strategy
for taking the fortress.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:56.850
This region is rich in forest resources

00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:00.150
and has long been protected
by the Shi clan.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:05.860
Our investigation shows iron goods
are being routed to Shishou.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.030
On top of that,
there are hot springs in the area,

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:11.620
so sulfur is easy to obtain.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:15.870
There also appear to be caves
from which saltpetre can be extracted.

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:21.170
Sulfur and saltpetre... Combine those
and you have gunpowder.

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:23.590
Shishou is likely stockpiling firearms

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.590
in preparation for battle.

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:29.840
- Feifa?
- Those are ill-suited to siege warfare.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.470
If you want to wipe out enemies
from atop the walls.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.600
Cannons, then.

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:43.190
We will likely suffer major losses
just approaching the fortress.

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:44.860
How troublesome.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:50.110
However, it is theoretically possible to
suppress them without allowing cannon use.

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:52.320
Even this walking abacus agrees.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.780
So what is the plan?

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:56.280
We strike the gunpowder store first,

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:58.540
before they can use the cannons.

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:02.170
It is a bit of an unorthodox tactic.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:04.840
I see.

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:07.750
It would be highly cost-effective.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:08.800
However,

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.720
there is an issue.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.390
What issue?

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.180
A surprise attack... by the Forbidden Army?

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:17.970
The Forbidden Army,

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.600
the army directly under the Emperor.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.860
That means we must
carry out this operation with dignity.

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:30.530
I agree with the Grand Commandant,

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.950
we must minimize casualties.

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:34.820
Understood.

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:37.330
- Then, Lahan.
- Yes.

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:44.040
From now on, you will need to change
how you deal with that girl.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.130
I am aware.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.800
Lord Lakan.
A report from the scouting unit.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.590
The snow is expected to stop by nightfall.

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:56.760
The operation can proceed.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.140
Have the Fire Squad move out immediately.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.560
Yes, sir!

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:03.940
Wait for me, Maomao.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.900
Papa's coming to save you.

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:13.400
I cannot sleep.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:17.740
There is still time
before the Forbidden Army arrives.

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:23.750
They are deliberately indulging in
pleasure in a place where I can hear you.

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:27.290
She has gathered only those women
from the clan

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:30.460
who bore children and were seen
as virtuous wives and mothers,

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:33.720
just to watch them degrade themselves
with male courtesans.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.680
She was not that kind of woman.

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:49.480
Oh, the Forbidden army has not moved yet.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.940
That shock just now.

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:54.650
Oh!

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:58.450
The underground gunpowder workshop?

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.700
I must act fast.

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:06.330
Even though I know that, I cannot move.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.170
How pathetic.

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:12.250
I have not had a proper night's sleep
in 20 years.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:16.550
That was when my suffering began.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.220
I have a favor to ask of you.

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:24.480
I want you to take my daughter
as your wife.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:29.190
She was cast out of the Imperial Court
as the daughter of a court physician

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.610
who had an illicit affair with Taihou,

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:34.360
and she has suffered greatly since.

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:37.200
She should have lived
in the Imperial Court

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.780
as a proper Imperial princess,
lacking for nothing.

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:44.250
I had no desire to marry,

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:49.750
but I couldn't refuse the former
emperor's plea as he grew weaker daily.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:54.090
Shishou, you are my loyal retainer.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:59.340
If you accept,
I will grant you anything you desire.

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:05.180
I had a fiancée,
who had entered the rear palace.

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.060
If you truly will grant me anything.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:15.530
I took the former emperor's daughter
as my wife, and Suirei was born.

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:20.490
Then my fiancée, Shenmei,
came back from the rear palace,

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:22.740
and this is the result.

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:34.420
What was that noise just now?

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.050
I am just about to find out.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:44.010
What are you wearing, Loulan?
Such indecency.

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:46.930
I would rather not hear that from you.

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:50.100
You abandon your children
and indulge in pleasure.

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.350
You have no right to speak.

00:12:58.190 --> 00:12:59.360
Loulan?

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.820
Is this, really my daughter?

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:05.830
I always thought she was
obedient to Shenmei, like a doll,

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:08.540
dressing up however she was told.

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:13.080
Sister, I am sorry I am late.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.170
She is far too practiced for this
to be her first time.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:22.840
I knew Shenmei resented Suirei,

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:26.600
but to think she was beaten
like this regularly

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:30.560
while I was away at Imperial Court.

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:34.100
What a failure of a father I am.

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:36.820
Father.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.740
Take responsibility, at least at the end.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.200
Loulan.

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.410
You are the old tanuki of Fox Village.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.750
Let us keep up the illusion
to the very end.

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.680
What! What is this?

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:21.280
An avalanche?

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:25.030
The armory!
If that gets buried, we cannot fight!

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:27.990
There is no gunpowder either. I burned it.

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:29.870
Loulan, you!

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:32.200
You knew we could not win this fight.

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:36.710
Father, I will stay with Mother.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.340
Take responsibility, huh?

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:44.340
Yes.

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:47.220
This is my responsibility.

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.220
The armory's been buried in snow!

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:51.560
Get more men!

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:54.350
There's no time
before the Forbidden Army attacks.

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:01.320
Whoa! Enemy assault!

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:08.070
Forbidden Army? When did they get here?

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:09.410
Fight back!

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:21.630
The enemy is in chaos! Strike all at once!

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:31.060
Do not kill those who have
no will to fight. Capture them!

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.310
Fewer soldiers than I expected.

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:36.350
It seems many of the frontline troops

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:39.980
moved toward the buildings
to deal with the fire.

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:41.820
- We move forward.
- Yes, sir!

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:45.320
I can't believe such a reckless plan
actually worked.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:50.070
But even more surprising
is that the old man Shishou,

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:52.370
who they used to call
a wily old tanuki in court,

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:54.580
is holed up in a place like this.

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:56.460
But more than that,

00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:00.790
the real shock was the so-called
heavenly maiden of a eunuch,

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:04.210
who turned out to be the commander

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:06.510
of the Forbidden Army.

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:10.590
Some might say this plan does not suit

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:13.550
a royal commanding the Forbidden Army.

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:16.640
But if we want to minimize our casualties,

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.520
it was the best course of action.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.690
I made that judgment myself.

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:25.110
I will take the blame
for the false strategy!

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:28.490
Seriously, what kind of head comes up
with a plan like this,

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.320
and what kind of person

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.950
actually follows through with it?

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:38.960
Hey, you! What is the situation inside?

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:43.210
We need to put out the fire quickly,
or Madame will.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:47.380
Wait!

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.090
- Any advice?
- Yes.

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:52.300
Go ahead.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:54.220
Well, I'll take your word for it.

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:57.850
With all this smoke,
we should not stay long.

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:02.020
Let those who are inside
also go outside immediately.

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.730
I am aware.

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:07.110
But there may be people
who cannot escape on their own.

00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:09.860
Then we will search for them.

00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:11.360
It is not that simple.

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:16.160
I really wish the noble one
would stay somewhere safer.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.870
The daughter of Grand Commandant
is being held here.

00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:23.000
- Here?
- Yes.

00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:27.920
If we abandon her,
a new political enemy will be born, right?

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.970
Indeed.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:36.680
Then I will simply do my duty.

00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:43.900
Is that...

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:48.980
No way. It couldn't be.

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:55.070
The Forbidden Army will be here soon.

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:58.740
If I stay, they might think
I am one of the Shi Clan.

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:00.620
But still.

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:03.080
I leave the rest to you.

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:05.920
She should have run.

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:10.090
What a fool.
But I'm just as bad as Shisui.

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.350
At least let it be someone
who will listen to me!

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:38.950
Excuse me.
Can you grant me protection, Lord Jinshi?

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:41.160
Are you injured? You are bleeding.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.370
No worries, it's not my blood.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.330
That still counts as a problem!

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:47.580
- It is snake blood.
- Snake?

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:51.340
I kind of missed this feeling.

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:53.920
- Hey, that--
- Huh?

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:56.840
Crown Prince!

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.720
I am not Crown Prince anymore.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.520
Consort Gyokuyou has given birth
to the royal heir.

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.060
Crown Prince.

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.850
So that is Lord Jinshi's true identity.

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:10.230
Things did seem off because
he did not match the supposed age

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:14.860
of the Emperor's younger brother, 19,
while he himself is 25.

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:18.030
Lord Jinshi, you look older than your age.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.000
- Is Lihaku here?
- Yes!

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:25.080
I'll leave the rest to you.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.050
Forgive the question,

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:37.720
but you resemble a Imperial Court girl
named Maomao.

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:39.050
It's me.

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:40.800
What are you doing here?

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.010
I was kidnapped.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.350
Your father.

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:46.560
Please do not say his name.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.310
Just say "that old man" or something.

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:50.650
Got it.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.320
My bad.

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:55.190
If you say so, I believe it.

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:59.450
Still, what a mess you are.
Covered in blood.

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:01.200
It is snake blood.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.780
Please, don't tell me
you have any injuries.

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:07.000
That old man pulled his back
trying to do something reckless.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.500
Now he can't move.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:13.090
Was the avalanche and the surprise attack

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:15.300
part of that old man's plan?

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.090
Yeah.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.720
Who's sleeping?

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:24.680
Children. But they're not breathing.

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.430
Seems like they took poison.

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:28.270
I see.

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:31.610
Even if they survived,
the entire clan would be executed.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.110
Women and children alike.

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:36.360
It is unbearable.

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.110
Will the executed

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:41.200
be thrown away?

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:44.620
No, they will be cremated and buried.

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:48.700
Then, may I at least have them
buried together with their mother?

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:51.960
That's not my job.

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:58.550
Looks like they are just sleeping.

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:01.510
- Hey! Give me a hand here!
- Yes.

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:03.050
Sir Lihaku?

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.600
We cannot just leave them lying here.

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:09.560
I cannot grant a proper joint burial,

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.900
but I can quietly bury him
near the cemetery, is what I can do.

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:14.810
Will you not get in trouble?

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:18.360
Who knows? If it comes to that,
you figure something out.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.240
I don't know if I can do
something about it.

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:24.450
Oh! Got a great idea.

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:27.740
How about you call that old man "Papa"?

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:30.040
Then I might do anything.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.420
Wait, forget I said that!

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:39.760
That flute?

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.380
A signal. To mark mission complete.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:51.810
Now let us go. Getting you out safely

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.770
is my job.

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:13.040
I will carry out what Shisui
entrusted to me.

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:14.620
That is all.
